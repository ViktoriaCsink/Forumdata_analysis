4159534,DH lost laptop and now assignment will be late,am_i_being_unreasonable,2021-02-08 20:32:56.000 +0000,"Yay! Glad you found the laptop!

Perhaps have a rule that he's not allowed to borrow your laptop at all. Sounds harsh but if it's that vital for your course maybe it needs to be off limits so this doesn't happen again. There's no way he can guarantee that he won't place it somewhere random again (without thinking) at a vital moment for you so you have this stress again.  

I have ADHD btw. I wouldn't want responsibility for something so important to someone else. He should have his own laptop that he can then leave where he wants. 

One further thought - I found this book amazing for ADHD friendly organisation tips. The best book I've read and has really helped me at home:

And he really has to stop the major organisation all at once. I have done this soooo many times and have realised I have to do small bits at a time. Otherwise I end up with EVERYTHING out everywhere and then lose all momentum and get really overwhelmed and don't know what to do with anything.  And then it sits there for weeks and weeks. No massive sort outs needs to be the rule. 

And if you need to do one, do a planned one together. I find it much easier to sort the garage for example if my husband is able to help keep me on track and focussed on the task and not get sidetracked and also he helps when I get stuck and don't know what to do with something. Which can lead to buffering. 

Anyway waffling again. So will go now. Hope some of that helps!

Also a lot of the groundwork is done at home, so youâ€™d need MIL to put the time and effort in while you arenâ€™t around as well as on walks.

If you do want to give it a go I would recommend [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Total-Recall-Perfect-Response-Training/dp/1846891493/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&crid=1K46UY61CBOWH&keywords=total+recall+pippa+mattinson&sprefix=Total+recal%2Caps%2C169&tag=mumsnetforu03-21&qid=1611308081&sr=8-1 Total Recall by Pippa Mattinson]].  

In addition to whistle training, ideally, you need to teach them that staying with you and you MIL is far more fun and rewarding than running after every person/dog they see on the horizon.  What do they love most, food/toys/attention?  Use whichever it is or a mix of them to get them focussed on you and ignore the distraction.  Again though, lots of groundwork to be done at home before they would be reliable enough to allow off on walks and if MIL is unwilling to have them on a lead/longline itâ€™s going to be difficult."

The first one is a cookbook called On the side, by Ed Smith. It is by far, the book that suggest diet fort the widest variety of vegetable . Plenty of recipes with lentils and chickpeas as well. Just remember that you can not add salt until you have removed the baby's plate. 
The other is not a cookbook but a reflection on how we eat and how we discover it form early age. It is called First bites by Bee Wilson. [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/First-Bite-How-Learn-Eat/dp/0465064981?tag=mumsnetforu03-21]]

When starting with fruit, you can make apple sauce but simmering piece of apples in minimal water. Pear sauce is equally delicious, and pear will develop a sort of vanilla taste when cooked. Banana is easier poached if baby hasn't developed mastication (boiling water, cut pieces of banana, cook for 2 min, remove banana without  adding any water, blend or crush) 
If you can, don't used canned fruit. A canned apricot tastes nothing like a real one. 
My strongest recommendation remains to avoid the baby snack food aisle and the baby crips, baby puffs, baby bars. Processed food are addictive, nutrition void  and don't taste like and altered tastebuds is recognised as a consequence of processed food [[https://life.spectator.co.uk/articles/processed-food-is-having-a-sinister-effect-on-our-taste-buds/]]"

I know I've been reading more than usual just to avoid the squabbling from the DCs...

Thank you very much for your thoughtful reviews, *Keith* - I really enjoyed reading them!

Thank you also to *southeastdweller* for keeping these threads going all year (and for heeding our pleas for a final 2020 one - I've got lots of reviews to catch up on and would feel weird putting them on a 2021 thread!)

I'm now on books 95 and 96 (and am wondering whether I can push through to 100 with a bit of judicious children's book reading, or whether this is a futile goal and I'm only cheating myself [grin]) so I'm going to update in batches as I can't face doing all of the reviews at once.

*The Carer by Deborah Moggach*
Enjoyably tart book about two late middle-aged siblings whose lives are turned upside-down when their father gets a new live-in carer. At first, Robert and Phoebe see Mandy as a complete â€œtreasureâ€ â€“ yes, sheâ€™s a bit â€œcommonâ€, but she seems devoted and enthusiastic about her work and they are relieved that they can pay her to do the caring that they donâ€™t want to/canâ€™t do themselves. But their father (an octogenarian professor emeritus of particle physics) seems to be changing oddly under Mandyâ€™s influence, and the siblings start to wonder if all is as it seemsâ€¦ Things come to a head halfway through the book (not in the way that Iâ€™d expected!) and all sorts of things come out of the woodwork; the second half of the book examines the fall-out and the events leading up to it from various perspectives. Iâ€™d assumed this was going to be a Sophie Hannah-style thriller with a devious â€œtwistâ€ but it wasnâ€™t like that at all. Instead, Moggach casts a rather beady eye on family relationships (between parents and children, between siblings, and between spouses), on ageing, and on the interplay between money, intelligence, success and opportunity. The characters are realistically unlikeable at times and, although thereâ€™s a certain amount of social satire going on, there isnâ€™t a lot of flab either. I enjoyed this a lot!

*The Deaths of December by Susi Holliday*
Competent police procedural that I bought in a charity shop last January and have been saving up for Christmas this year. A serial killer (referred to for most of the book as â€œThe Photographerâ€) sends a grisly advent calendar to the local CID; behind most of the doors is a photograph of a crime scene from an unsolved murder, which only the killer could have taken. Needless to say, there is also an elaborate code involved, linking dates, locations and numbered doors on the calendar. Can the police catch the killer before the last few empty doors are filled? (Yes, of course they can.) There was nothing earth-shattering about this book, but the writing was not terrible and the exploration of the charactersâ€™ back stories raised it above many other pot-boilers of this type.

*The Thirteen Days of Christmas by Jenny Overton*
A childhood favourite that I havenâ€™t read for ages, which was brought to mind recently by a conversation with DD (and I see that *ChessieFL* also read it very recently). I was fretting that it wouldnâ€™t live up to my memories of it, but I neednâ€™t have worried â€“ it was wonderful [smile]. The four Kitson children live with their widowed father Ralph; the oldest daughter, Anne (who prefers to be known as â€œAnnapleâ€ because she has romantic notions) is being wooed by the wealthy young merchant Francis Vere, but wonâ€™t have him because she feels that he is too prosaic. The younger three children conspire to get Annaple married off (partly because theyâ€™ve had enough of her terrible cooking), and egg Francis on to think of more and more ludicrously romantic gifts to present to Annaple on each of the twelve days of Christmas.

Like a lot of my favourite books from childhood (it was first published in 1974, and I would have read it in the mid-1980s), it involves a historical setting â€“ weirdly, this is never mentioned explicitly, but judging from Shirley Hughesâ€™ illustrations, I reckon itâ€™s some time in the second half of the 17th century. The setting, the understated period details and the spare but evocative language all meant that this was a magical read for me â€“ like *The Children of Green Knowe* and *The Dark is Rising*, both of which Iâ€™ve also just re-read. Like those books, it is really wonderful at evoking atmosphere â€“ each of the chapters is titled with the relevant feast for that day (so not just St Stephenâ€™s Day, but also Churching Day, Adamâ€™s Day, Eveâ€™s Day and Dancing Day). The celebrations and carols for that day frame the action, and give a real sense of Christmastide as a time for communal celebration rather than just personal feasting/present acquisition or sickly â€œfamily timeâ€ as modern books tend to emphasise. I donâ€™t know why itâ€™s taken me so long to re-read this (probably because it was in a box under my bed until a couple of months ago [blush]) but itâ€™s definitely going to be a regular re-read from now on!

*Dead Famous by Greg Jenner*
I started this months ago and then got bogged down and distracted by other books. Once Iâ€™d got going again, I flew through it! Itâ€™s an entertaining but fundamentally serious-minded look at the history of celebrity: when did we start to have â€œcelebritiesâ€, what is the difference between â€œcelebrityâ€, â€œfameâ€ and â€œnotorietyâ€, and how did people become (and stay) famous in the past? There are loads of colourful and entertaining anecdotes, as you would expect, but there is also a serious attempt to grapple with cultural theory and to put it in its proper context (as the historical consultant for Horrible Histories, I reckon Greg Jenner is probably uniquely suited to this job). Chapters cover the routes to stardom, money, celebrity bodies and merchandise, and everything is meticulously referenced (he mentions in the epilogue that it took him 6 years and 1.4 million words of notes to put this book together, and I believe it â€“ it even spills over [[https://www.gregjenner.com/dead-famous-full-references-bibliography/ onto his website]]!). Among the more obvious suspects like Byron, Lizst and WG Grace, you get to find out about the now-forgotten stars of their age, like the firebrand Tory clergyman Henry Sacheverell (arguably the first modern â€œcelebrityâ€), the sultry dancer ClÃ©o de MÃ©rode (whose affair with King Leopold of Belgium led to the brilliant portmanteau nickname ClÃ©opold, and whose fans were creepily obsessed with her ears), the â€œdivine Master Bettyâ€ (a Regency child star who was a cross between Shirley Temple and The Beatles), and, er, Clara the Rhino (who was the hottest star to tour 1740s Europe).

*A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens*
Havenâ€™t read this for years, but it was a lovely way to spend Christmas/Boxing Day (I listened to the Hugh Grant version that Audible are giving away free at the moment). Iâ€™d forgotten how funny some of it is!

*Grimble and Grimble at Christmas by Clement Freud*
Another book I havenâ€™t read for at least 20 years! Grimble is a boy of about 10 (â€œYou may think it is silly to say someone is ^about^ ten, but Grimble had rather odd parents who were very vague and seldom got anything completely rightâ€). This book is really two long short-stories put together. In the first, Grimble comes home from school one Monday to find an empty house; his parents have left a globe with two flags stuck in it, one in England (saying â€œGRIMBLEâ€) and one in Peru (saying â€œUSâ€). Further notes around the house (his parents like leaving cryptic and sometimes trolling notes around the house) suggest five different people he can call on while they are away, from Colonel Featherstone to the station master. Each day, he calls on a different person, only to find that they are also mysteriously out and have left him notes with instructions on how to make dinner. In this way, he manages to spend the time until his parents return. The second half is about Grimbleâ€™s attempts to earn enough money for a â€œproperâ€ Christmas because he thinks that his parents will be too forgetful/disorganised to do it themselves (not quite as sad or neglectful as that makes it sound!).

The book is illustrated by Quentin Blake, and is a bizarre mixture of surreal humour and cookery advice (Clement Freud was both a food writer and an MP when he wrote this book) that was right up my street. To give you a flavour of it: [Grimbleâ€™s parents have sent him a telegram saying â€œTHINKING ABOUT YOU. MESSAGE IN THE IRONING CUPBOARD. DONâ€™T FORGET TEETH. LOVE FATHER AND MOTHER.â€]

â€œHe went up to the ironing cupboard, rummaged about a bit among the clothes, and finally in the pocket of his bathing trunks he found the message. It was written in green ink on a large squashed-fly biscuit and said, DO NOT EAT THIS BISCUIT BECAUSE EATING GREEN INK IS BAD FOR YOU. LOVE FATHER AND MOTHER. â€˜If that is a grown-up joke I am glad I am a child,â€™ though Grimble, brushed his teeth angrily, and looked at the list of people his parents had told him to go and see if he needed anything.â€

*Ruth's First Christmas Tree by Elly Griffiths*
I downloaded this 6 months ago as a [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ruths-First-Christmas-Tree-Galloway-ebook/dp/B009P1WFEY?tag=mumsnetforu03-21 Kindle freebie]] and this seemed as good a time as any to read it. Itâ€™s a short story that is number 4.5 in the series, going between *A Room Full of Bones* and *A Dying Fall* (indeed, thereâ€™s a long excerpt from the latter at the end of this book). It was weird going back so far in the series now that Iâ€™m on book 12 and a lot has happened in Ruthâ€™s turbulent love/professional/crime-fighting life! The story itself is pretty short but sweet â€“ not the most enthralling mystery (in fact there are a couple of loose ends left untied) but a nice, easy, atmospheric read for fans of the series."

Not sure if itâ€™s the right sort of thing but the poor womanâ€™s sons were murdered by her abusive husband who she got together with when she was just 16 (he was older).

DH argued a LOT after DC1 was born and we ended up having couple's counselling as things didn't improve. That helped us massively. Now DC2 is here we are arguing again so I suppose it's inevitable. I'm wondering whether we should have some ""refresher"" counselling. Anyway, don't know if that's helpful but you're not alone!

One thing that pisses me off is that I do all the research, I do obsessive Googling, asking friends for advice, reading Mumsnet thread, reading parenting books... but he does fuck all. I'm also the one doing the vast majority of the childcare (breastfeeding so doing night feeds and also on maternity leave while he works). So actually I get final say if we can't agree. If he doesn't like it, tough! I have told him that I'd like us to make parenting decisions as equal and he does have the right to a say so perhaps he could kindly educate himself and then we can have a conversation. Funnily enough he never fucking bothers. He does listen to me though thankfully. If he refused to listen or research I'd probably tell him to fuck off.

About your baby's digestive issues - sometimes they can be caused by cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) although if your baby is tolerating formula that's probably unlikely. You mentioned that you had a c-section. Sometimes probiotics can help, BioGaia baby ones are good.

Hang on in there. I find the arguments one of the worst things about having a baby [sad] [flowers] But it does pass or at least it did in our case after a lot of counselling and just time as baby got older and easier to look after."

Expressing can be tricky but some people find it easy. I think the key is to remember that when you're expressing, you're really getting the ""excess"" milk. Babies are more efficient than a pump and when a baby is feeding, you're getting all kinds of biological feedback which signal to your body that your baby is feeding and hence make more milk. A pump only really recreates two of these signals - the removal of milk and the sucking action (nipple stimulation). What you don't have is oxytocin, skin to skin, the smell of your baby and the hormonal feedback. You can often train your body to produce more by expressing regularly, indeed, that's what happens when someone exclusively pumps milk or pumps a large proportion of their baby's milk. But if you don't pump regularly, then you'll find as your milk supply regulates over the first 3-6 months and you stop leaking etc, you'll stop producing excess and then if you want to express after this point, you'll probably find you don't produce anything for the pump any more. It is then possible to increase pumping supply, but if you just want to do it as and when for the odd evening out etc, I (personally) found that wasn't really possible after about 6 months.

A lot of people like the idea of expressing for a bottle for their partner to feed, in reality I think this can end up being more work for you than you save by having your partner do one feed! Especially if you end up responsible for cleaning and sterilising the pump and bottle, organising storage of the milk, etc. OTOH, if you find you leak a lot, you can use breast shells or there's a ""passive"" pump out now called a Haakaa, which can be used to collect run-off milk that you're leaking, for example during feeding your baby, which is a common time to leak. This can then be decanted into a bottle to use as an extra feed, which can be no effort at all! But it doesn't work for everyone. I didn't leak a lot with DS1 and not at all with DS2.

I don't think nipple confusion is as big of an issue as people seem to think it is. Maybe for very tiny babies who are still learning to latch. I suppose it's good to be aware of it as a potential problem, but I def wouldn't get too hung up on it. OTOH a lot of people think if they introduce a bottle too late, then babies won't take to them at all but I don't think this is true either. Bottle refusal just seems to be a random thing that some babies decide to do at about 3-4 months old, and they will do it whether they have had a bottle beforehand or not.

I would say that 10+ hour cluster feeding sessions are rare (and tend to spread into the night if that happens anyway). If it gets too much at any point, you can always just put the baby down and go to another room. Yes, they might cry, but even if what they really want is milk, dads or other people can develop calming strategies for babies all of their own, and if there really is nobody else, they will be OK while you get your breath back for 5 minutes. Cluster feeding is common, but it's normally more like 2-3 hours at a time in the early evening, at a time when you generally want to be sat on your bum watching TV anyway, so it's not tooo bad to be immobile, it can be quite a nice excuse! Or set up your bed for safe co-sleeping (even if you don't want to do this as their main sleep space) and doze. Buy your partner a cookery book now if they don't currently cook [wink], batch cook for the freezer during late pregnancy and getting acquainted with a slow cooker and your local takeaways is also not a bad idea, because it does tend to happen right at tea time and breastfeeding makes you hungry. Cluster feeding is wearing but I think if you're expecting it, it's not quite as bad as if you are expecting them to feed for 10 minutes and then be put down for the next 2-4 hours.

Midwives in theory should be able to help you with establishing feeding, but unfortunately they don't all have good training or experience with BF... sometimes their advice can be really good, but sometimes it can be incomplete. I'd recommend that anyone who wants to BF locates a source near them which is reliable - whether that's a book or helpline or a support group or an IBCLC - it's just unfortunately a bit of a postcode lottery and a lot of NHS areas don't have breastfeeding support on staff, other than the very basic training midwives have (which might have been years ago and half forgotten). Health visitors aren't usually trained in breastfeeding, and neither are GPs. Hospitals tend to want you out ASAP even in normal times because they need the beds! But you should get midwife home visits up to about day 10 before being discharged back to HV.

I'm right here with you with all the alcohol drinking. I've had a drink everyday since Xmas. We've also been sleeping and waking up late - only God (and DH) knows what my temps are doing. Hopefully you're able to see a clear temp shift despite it all. I'm still a week away from ovulation!

Haha I ordered [[https://www.amazon.com/FertilAid-Men-Fertility-Supplement-Morphology/dp/B0006HDOSM?tag=mumsnetforu03-21 these]] for him as well as the ones for sperm count and motility (just in case). They have really good reviews but I only thought he'd need to take three separate pills, not 3 of one, 2 of another and 2 of another. Oh well! The things we do to keep the wife happy.

Haha I can imagine your DP begrudgingly wearing the PJs. But like I said... The things we do to keep the wife (or fiancee) happy ðŸ˜‚ Me too! PJs all day everyday. I actually ordered five more so that I had a nice rotation available.

A maxi dress would definitely be what I'd go for too with that fabric - so pretty! I think you should leave it baggy and create a waist belt for it. That way you can tighten it around your waist but have the loose, flowy look too.

I've started using visualisers to see what rugs and tiles would look like in the new house. I really like this beige rug. I think it suits the floorboards and the fireplace. And the bathroom currently has blue floor tiles which I want to paint a dark grey/slate colour. But I still don't like the blue trim on the walls so might replace them. What do you think?"
4086583,9DPO Symptom Spotting,conception,2021-02-04 11:55:06.000 +0000,"Yay! Go temps go! Glad it's progressing so well for you! Fingers crossed for a longer LP and highest temps ever! Just checked your overlay chart and these are your highest temps at 7DPO so far! How exciting! My temp did exactly what it did last cycle. At 5DPO it flattened and I have a flat temp today as well. It might start going up from tomorrow. I'm thinking secondary estrogen surge keeping my temps down?

Oooooo imagine if you have a little bean in there right now searching for the perfect spot to snuggle into!!! Hopefully over the next few days, your temps will shoot up ðŸ“ˆ I know charts can't show or predict pregnancy so early on but it'll be really interesting to see what happens.

I'm feeling a bit bleh this morning. Have a bit of a headache. I've been having them on and off over the last few days. Quite tired too so feeling a bit groggy. My leg is much better! I asked DH to give me a massage last night and he decided to unleash the strength of a thousand oxen onto it, nearly took my skin off - but it must have worked! I guess the pain was muscular ðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸ symptom spotting isn't fun when there's a logical explanation ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜‚ I'll need to remember to do my progesterone test tomorrow too!

If I get a BFP this cycle, I want to buy [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07Z3Y5ZP4/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=A2RCXAQDK3T42M&psc=1&tag=mumsnetforu03-21 this box]] and put the HPT inside it and give it to DH on Valentine's Day. It's such an overdone thing to do but I think Valentine's Day would be the least suspicious time to do it because people generally exchange gifts then (although the box shape might be a dead giveaway. I'll have to choose another shape.) Would you tell your DP straight away if you got a BFP or wait until Val's Day?

I remember when my mum was pregnant with my siblings. Excess saliva was one of her symptoms. She used to carry around a bottle to spit in ðŸ¤¢ I really hope I don't get that!! Do you remember any of your mums symptoms through her pregnancies?

I *could* sleep on my side if I tried. I seem to go through cycles where my sleeping position changes. I used to sleep on my side quite a lot but for some reason, I prefer my front now and can't sleep on my side anymore. But those pregnancy pillow sound like a dream! I'll take two please! 

I can't remember tbh, it couldn't have been too long after we started dating. The full story is now one of those stories you tell amongst friends and laugh your head off. I wish it was my most embarrassing story too, but I've had worse happen to me. What's the most embarrassing thing to ever happen to you?

The funny thing is, I have the biggest boobs in my family (so far, as my little cousin seems to be catching up) I think it's from the paternal side of me. My sisters and I have different dads and they're both flat chested. Is there a feature that all your family members have inherited? In my family, it's our lack of a bum and waist. We're not a very shapely family - we're all very boxy ðŸ“¦ðŸ˜‚

He has an exercise bike too! He doesn't use it. That's why I'm even more annoyed ðŸ˜  If we created an outdoor gym, that would be great because then the equipment would have a dedicated space. I want to buy [[https://billyoh.com/tessa-summerhouse/26233 this]]. We have a hot tub too so I'd be looking to put it inside something like [[https://billyoh.com/holly-summerhouse/26099 this]]. Then at least we'd have a gym area for fitness and relaxation (obviously I won't be using the hot tub as I don't go inside water). Since you have a big garden, you could erect an outdoor building. It might be cold in winter without any insulation but a cool environment is great when you're working out â„ï¸ðŸ¥¶

ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜± What! Sleep can affect fertility. That's crazy! The body has to be a perfect system or else, it seems, if something is out of balance, it can impact other areas of the body ðŸ˜± Gosh, there seems to be 1001 reasons for infertility and pinpointing it must be impossible. Can't believe 10 years of bad sleep caused this!! But she finally got her happily ever after. Hopefully my LP-induced insomnia is mostly caused by anxiety and not me waking up a million times in the night ðŸ˜±"

You have the unique opportunity to shape your baby's taste. Focus on the food you want him/her growing up eating. You want your baby to eat vegetables , give vegetables, and stay away from ultra processed baby food (puffs, veggie sticks, baby crisps, cereal bars, ....). 
Even minimally processed baby food should;d be the exception and not the rule. 
Be mindful that pouches and jars don't taste like their fresh food equivalent, and a baby will develop a preference for the taste that is given. A lot of pouches also have sweetness as a dominating taste, so use sweet veggies such as carrot, sweetcorn or add fruit to veggies to make it more palatable. 
Baby porridge is very sweet.

The main point will always be to focus on the food, not how it reaches the mouth (spoon or finger). The industry has jumped on this concept that you need ""finger food"" for development and offers a wide range of highly processed addictive food. 
Read a bit about nutrition and how important it is to offer variety and diversity of taste and texture. 
It doesn't have to be the spoon. or the finger. I use my fingers for blueberries but a spoon for soups. 
You need to talk with your partner about what would be the best food for your child to eat, what you wouldn't want them to be and plan their weaning accordingly"

Both of these cups have a flat design, so they surround the cervix with their rim and sit flat against it. Menstrual cups sit at the top of the vaginal canal, still close but not as close to the cervix. Also, menstrual cups have a shape that allows them to collect liquids, so it might be more difficult for sperm to escape. The fertilily cup, I honestly don't see the point of because, sure, it will keep semen close to the cervix after intercourse but, given that we use SI, best to have two birds with one stone imho. ðŸ˜‰ 

I personally prefer that DH ejaculates straight into the soft disc and I insert it immediately, within the first 10 seconds. That way, I know that the semen is as fresh as possible and has not been handled at all by swirling it, leaving it to liquify, sucking it with a syringe. All these understandably damage the sperm. So, all in all, I agree with your DP!"

I'm sorry I've been MIA, I've just been all consumed by my desperation to ovulate so I'm in with a chance! 

To recap for anyone newer, I had my MVA on the 14th January. So just over three weeks ago! I'm getting vvvfl on FRER and Wondfo cheapies - just a side note here, the Wondfo cheapies are just as sensitive as the FRERs?! And a million times cheaper haha!! They're advertised as 20mIU but I swear they must be at least 10 if not closer to the FRER level of 6... Lines are tracking the same on both. 

So I'm CD 23 today and my temp has finally dropped quite a bit! So think I may ovulate tomorrow possibly? I think it tends to follow that trend. Have been DTD every other day so ðŸ¤žðŸ»


Sorry I've not properly read through all the new joiners but I'm so glad you've found this support group as everyone's so friendly and just all round lovely!

A lot of women use woollen blankets and found them good but I cannot personally comment.
For supplements I have tried two- soya isoflavones which did not make any difference at all and second was Himalaya evecare which has Ashoka. Ashoka has natural estrogen properties. I found evecare much more helpful for night sweats and it also regulated my periods.
I did stop using it after 2 months so can't say about long term benefits."

But just seen the hangover part. He might be saying that as an excuse to not come and participate in Xmas and not offend you at the same time as he's learning how to communicate with you, or he's serious but if he's serious we wouldn't judge him, as he's new to Islam so baby steps!

You can just do a simple hamper type thing, like get a glass bottle of pure juice, Tony's chocolate (larger Sainsbury's have them), a large bag of salt n vinegar crisps (tk maxx has loads that look fancy), something he may use that you know as his sister like I dunno a winter scarf or something.

Glass peanut butter jar? They have them in all supermarkets, a natural one. 
A jar of local honey.
Jam
A nice pack of nuts?
You can't go wrong with food lol.

That sort of thing. You will know what he likes better. Add some tissue paper and it will look nice. Write a little message saying this gift is because we support you on your journey... and in person say it's not an Xmas gift. 

Someone said a carved wooden Qur'an holder. That's a good idea. There's a shop called Islamic impressions. They have a nice one for Â£5 in store, can't see it online. You can call them up. They have free delivery when you spend Â£10 and lots of things on their website. 

It's really nice of you to think of him and want to remember him always. Remember random thoughts throughout the year are nice and from a Muslim perspective better than focusing on one day in a year. I'm sure he'll appreciate it whenever you give it although he probably won't expect anything. Kind words go a long way."

Get them good solid single beds with good quality, solid based drawers underneath, or use a wardrobe for all their clothes and a trofast or similar for toys. 

I think the key is to be judicious in what toys you buy and rotate things to the downstairs. They don't need a farm and a doll's house and a fire station and an airport and a toy garage, they can do a lot with a couple of carefully chosen ones and perhaps some extra cardboard boxes. Or if they're into dollies they don't need bunk beds and a pram and a buggy and a high chair and a car seat. Get them lots of small accessories (bottles, a real spoon and bowl, rattle, their own outgrown baby clothes and blankets), a fold up buggy, and teach them to use the actual furniture/ cardboard boxes/drawers etc to pretend the bigger stuff. And make tidy up time a habit every evening."

Nizoral is high in sulfates so that might be causing the dryness and irritation on forehead and sides of face. Itâ€™s actually fairly common for people to react to SLS in shampoo. My 16yo DD does and so uses baby shampoo. 

Stop using any face wash. Just use water. Until skin settles down. 

The moisturising cream Cerave contains petrolatum which is a known comedogenic that causes blocked pores/spots and so thatâ€™s probably why the cream resulted in spots emerging.  

You could try something gentler like pure aloe Vera gel which will moisturise and soothe without adding oils to her face.

I would use food obsession to your advantage.  Invest in some licki mats and food dispensing toys and puzzles to keep him busy, distract him from nicking your food and also from his pain.  Iâ€™ve recently bought my boy [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Trixie-34949-Snack-Snake-Tpr/dp/B07CXMKQ8M?tag=mumsnetforu03-21 this snake]] which is tricky to fill, but keeps him busy and focussed for over half an hour, after which he konks out and sleeps for hours.

Have a good read of the [[https://caninearthritis.co.uk/ Canine Arthritis Management website and maybe join their FB group]].  So many things you can do to help him with his joint pain day to day.  Obviously he also needs a vet assessment and I would imagine regular pain meds as well.

The teeth and abscess will most likely be the source of the smell.  Again, as you already know, vet is your first stop, but daily use of something like [[https://www.petdrugsonline.co.uk/virbac-hexarinse-cat-dog-mouthwash Virbac Hexarinse]] will make a massive difference in the meantime, as it destroys the bacteria that makes the smell and also discourages plaque formation.  If he wonâ€™t have it as a mouthswash, you can just soak a microfibre dog toothbrush in the liquid and rub it liberally around his gums and teeth.

Are you lifting his feet to dry them or just wanting him to wait on the mat for a couple of minutes. If heâ€™s objecting to having his feet lifted, itâ€™s probably due to the joint pain, so investing in a really good quality, thick absorbent mat instead might be a better option. Iâ€™d invest in a really decent quality door mat, as big as you can fit in the available space.  Theyâ€™re prices, but Hug Rugs and Turtle Mats are much better at absorbing the dirt/wet quickly.  Alternatively [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B082MPP3VV/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_9?smid=A39DCAT3C6531Q&psc=1&tag=mumsnetforu03-21 these]] are cheaper, but still really good. We have them in grey and are waiting to order more when the grey comes back into stock.  Theyâ€™re lovely and soft underfoot as well.  (We have the runners around our kitchen to stop our arthritic dog from slipping.)

Pet insurance is likely to be difficult with a geriatric dog.  I think many of the bigger insurers wonâ€™t start new policies over the age of 8.  Hopefully someone with knowledge of one that does will be along soon.  Bear in mind that even if you do get a policy, teeth are unlikely to be covered and as the abscess is already there, that probably wonâ€™t be either. 

I would still go for third party insurance, even you canâ€™t get health cover though, especially as heâ€™s dog aggressive.  [[https://www.dogstrust.org.uk/get-involved/membership/ You can get it by becoming a member of the Dogs Trust.]]"

This enabled us to continue to swaddle even though baby had learned to roll over. Was brilliant- we all slept really well.

We tried to transition her out of the swaddle at 7.5 months using the love to dream transition swaddle. We released one arm for a few nights but found she was waving it around all night and disturbing herself. We ended up putting a long-ish sock over her hand/arm and that helped loads(we found this tip on an old MN thread!). So continued with her arm out and progressed to releasing the second arm and used the sock on it too. 

So far so good. Baby is no longer hitting her face or trying to pull the dummy out and is now no longer using the swaddle or wrap. And she is sleeping really well throughout the night.

Layout - roof is at front of house huge risk neigbours many shift workers would see and say something.  Plus security lights that would trigger which would risk altering us as our bedroom is at the front.

House layout - only really one room we wouldn't hear and then getting back in would be issue - we'd hear any doors and getting back up on the roof  to get in vai window would be hard and moving anything to stand on instantly noticable and there isn't really anything to drag to do that.  Plus as we have indoor cats they all love so they tend to not think of leaving windows open and ajar.


 Youngest window doesn't open quietly and she's in the room next door so we'd hear that one not least as cats insist our bedroom door is open to landing at night.

Plus there are four other people in the house - all of who would say something if one was out and they noticed.

But mainly don't think it's occured to any of them yet - when the get up they've gone for their phones kept downstairs at night  and the gaming compter downstairs and invariable get sent back to bed till a decent hour.  At the moment their friends aren't roaming around those hours either.

*ChristMyArse* --not sure I want to know how THAT username came about!-- 150-170g is a portion of Greek yogurt. Try adding some electrolytes to your water as 4 litres will flush out electrolytes. A sprinkle of salt and a squeeze of lemon juice (bottled lemon juice from the fridge is fine) will help replace sodium and potassium. If it's still a problem then try an [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00SP31TCW?ref=ppxpopmobapshare electrolyte powder]]r* or the Zero electrolyte tables if you don't mind artificial sweeteners. Watch out for creamy coffees as in general we shouldn't be drinking our calories. The constant insulin disruption from dairy can stall weight loss or cause cravings in some people so it's worth experimenting. If you're affected then keep dairy to no more than twice a day. Most people don't need to cut it out entirely unless they're very sensitive.

There are a lot of resources out there. Personally - as someone who celebrates DÃ­a de Muertos, but doesn't believe in an individualistic afterlife - I try to talk about it in an age-appropriate way as part of life though I'm not sure I'd describe my method as reassuring. I do avoid euphemisms like being 'lost' or anything that associates sleep or leaving with death, but I also don't associate it with illness (I don't want them to think every illness is deadly) or old age (they're already aware that's not true). It's part of life like the seasons, we talk about those that have died and our ancestors (looking through findthegrave was interesting for mine). We talk about how we don't know when we'll die, we may have feelings about how we want what's left of us treated after death or what we think comes next or we may not, and that's okay."

I think the b vitamins would be more likely to regulate your cycle to something functional. Folk who use B6 to â€œlengthenâ€ their cycle are usually just improving their within cycle bleeding and regulating things overall, IYSWIM. It can seem that they have a short cycle because of the duration of bleeding.

Ideally you want a cycle that is about one calendar month long, with ovulation between days 10-14, with no spotting until a definite start to your period around day 28.

This is a really helpful book:

[[https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0091887585/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?psc=1&tag=mumsnetforu03-21&ie=UTF8]]

Youâ€™ll get there. But people telling you just to keep having sex when you have a long cycle are missing the point -the cycle has to be shortened to be ovulatory. Thatâ€™s not to say you might not randomly ovulate here and there, but the â€œjust sexâ€ approach can get really frustrating very quickly if you arenâ€™t doing anything else to improve the cycle and likelihood of ovulating. If someone is only ovulating 1-3x per year, is it really realistic to just keep having sex every couple of days for several years hoping to catch one of these ovulations? That kind of advice can really kill the intimacy in a relationship with sex becoming an endless chore..."

4102104,We took our eye off the ball and now DS is...,teenagers,2020-12-09 19:18:37.000 +0000,"I agree , it is worth considering something like ADHD as a possibility (just a possibility).  But as others have said since I started typing this (!) can we clarify that ADHD is not a learning â€œdisorderâ€, it is a neuro-diversity and can manifest as hyperactivity, impulsiveness or inattentiveness. Though ADHD can lead to academic and behaviour problems itâ€™s not an accurate gauge of ability/intelligence.  It has to do with the way the brain uses dopamine and the behaviour  describes in their excellent post is what psychiatrists sometimes call â€˜edgingâ€™; doing risky impulsive things to try and get that hit of dopamine.  Itâ€™s worth looking at OP, not in attempt to label and categorise but in order to formulate the best approach and better to check things out and be able to cross them off the list. 
I say this as someone who wasnâ€™t diagnosed with ADHD until 52!  Had a diagnosis been possible back when I was a teen it might have meant that my wild and risky behaviour and my inability to focus and apply myself would not just have been put down to being bad, lazy and stupid.  In the end I got a good degree and career but the path there was very bumpy.

I have a 15 yo DS (he doesnâ€™t have ADHD) and he changed from a sunny and studious 11 into a moody and controversial 12 yo and by 13yo on a mission to push every possible boundary and experiment with every vice.  I agree with the previous posters like  who suggest trying to get him to engage with an activity that is managed by people who really understand the chemical shit storm that is being a teen and will interact with him differently from his parents.  This might give him a way of channelling some of the teen stuff and it might also dilute some friendships by meeting others.  If your DS is anything like mine then itâ€™s important that the suggestion to join some scheme, club, interest group does not come from you!  This takes some creativeness on your part, but he probably needs to feel heâ€™s driving it.  Perhaps there is another male he values such as an older teen who could interact with him/suggest a scheme or interest? Iâ€™ve also found that Iâ€™ve had to change the way I respond to my son and act in a fairly controlled and non-emotional way.  So with vaping, instead of becoming hysterical and pleading with him to stop (which is my natural inclination frankly), I said to him that I know he does it and I recognise heâ€™s curious but that the studies of the dangers are only now coming out and the clever people are the ones that quit and donâ€™t allow the companies producing these things to convince them vaping is edgy or cool.  All said on various car journeys in a Socratic way, asking him his opinion, no lectures.  This roundabout way has allowed a channel of communication to stay open by and large and as he approaches 16 these things have lost their appeal on the whole.  I think youâ€™re entering a period of parenting where keeping a watchful eye, holding back and choosing your battles is required whilst trying to distract him with engagement in activities as above with strong role models, and all the while letting him know youâ€™re there and that heâ€™s loved. He will roll his eyes and may tell you he doesnâ€™t feel the same but it all goes in.  Anyway, thatâ€™s more or less how weâ€™ve stumbled through the teen thing. Itâ€™s not easy.

If you can, please get a copy of The Positive Birth Book ASAP and read it. It is very empowering and gives you the right language to get what you want from your birth.

Agree that you probably need to ask for a different midwife, or for a referral to the obstetrician so that you can talk about it properly.

If you do decide you want to try vaginal birth, all of the internal checks are voluntary and you can decline them. You can chose to do your own cervical examinations. The only time someone *has* to be up your vag is if you need stitches afterwards.

My birth plan is to have a vaginal birth with pain relief, but if that isnâ€™t working I will have a c section rather than forceps delivery. I am choosing to have a c section under general anaesthetic rather than spinal block for similar but different reasons to you. My midwife is fine with my choice and yours should be too.

Please read the book and become an empowered birth-zilla and advocate for what you want.

I never brush it dry. I came across curly girl a couple of years ago. I had always used the technique but not necessarily CG friendly products
My results still vary.
I would start by trying the techniques then adding product changes one at a time. My hair is quick to frizz and can quickly get overloaded with products 
At the moment I co wash then condition. I brush with conditioner in then squish it into my hair
After rinsing I put in a bit of leave in conditioner then squeeze out the water and brush again. I put gel on, I'm using naughty at the moment, and squeeze my hair to encourage curls and clumping. I usually clip the top up to dry with a claw grip for lift. I hardly touch it again. Perhaps a tiny bit of leave in or curl cream to finish off

4110879,Baby wonâ€™t stay latched on,breast_and_bottle_feeding,2020-12-20 21:26:05.000 +0000,"Hugs to you OP. I ended up exclusively pumping for my twins who couldnâ€™t latch properly- pretty sure it was tongue tie looking back but we had a lot more pressing issues to deal with - I was pumping anyway as they were tube fed so I kept going. 

Firstly, it sounds like youâ€™re using the wrong size flange (funnel bit) if repeatedly slipping off. Over time this will cause trauma - in the meantime if you have a stretchy bra you can spare, cut a cross in each cup as a makeshift hands free pumping bra. 

Consumer grade pumps are often a bit crap and often donâ€™t  come with different size flanges. I had an Ardo Calypso double pump which was brilliant, not expensive and comes with different sizes. Argos sell them and often have same day delivery on some things or amazon will deliver by Tuesday 
[[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ardo-Calypso-Double-Plus-Breastpump/dp/B00JNCTAKW/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?dchild=1&s=baby&keywords=ardo+calypso&sprefix=ardo+cal&tag=mumsnetforu03-21&qid=1608498828&sr=1-1]]

I think Ardo do next day delivery. 

[[https://www.ardobreastpumps.co.uk/shop/products/buy-a-breastpump/pump-up-the-volume/]]

If you canâ€™t get on with the one you have, I would get another. Good thing about Ardo Calypso is theyâ€™re a closed system so you can sell them on when youâ€™re done. 

Google the Stanford pumping technique - theres a very dated but very useful video. Combines pumping with breast compression to maximise supply.

If you want to try latching again then google the flipple technique - a way of getting a deeper latch often suggested when thereâ€™s a tie. Try some other holds - one of mine could only latch at all if lying on his right hand side, so experiment. Also have a look at rugby ball hold and laid back Feeding position, and try when he starting to get wriggly rather than crying with hunger - you can google hunger cues to show you what the earliest signs are. 

Unfortunately lots of tongue tie services are limited during COVID to those cases where the baby is not gaining weight etc. Definitely ask and be assertive  but also have a look online to see if anyone can do it privately at your home. I wish I had paid for this in hindsight but I didnâ€™t. 

I pumped every 2 hours round the clock at first which is hard going but unfortunately important to keep supply up. 

I remember only too well how desperate I felt when mine wouldnâ€™t latch - try not to panic, keep your supply up as best you can, try to get the tongue tie sorted, if you can afford it get some advice from an IBCLC lactation consultant. Just because he canâ€™t latch now doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s over - I know plenty whoâ€™ve pumped initially then managed to establish BFing, hell I even know people who have relactated after stopping completely. 

Hang in there, stay as calm as you can, stanford pumping, frequent pumping, different flanges / pump, deep latch, different holds and feed when calm before he gets too hangry. 

You can do it :)"

This might not be big enough or heavy enough for a ten Yr old you'll have to check it out. 

Sleep deprivation nearly destroyed my marriage too, still not recovered any intimacy and will see what happens when the children are older.

In the end the two things that worked best to help my Dd were bedtime tokens system, which is a bit like this :
[[https://www.drgreene.com/bedtime-pass-program]]
But we used loads of tokens at first and gradually reduced the number, so Dd used 32 the first night and gradually reduced down to 3, if she had tokens left in the morning she got a sweet (because sod it). 

And this technique that's used for adults with 'middle insomnia', so Dd always woke at 1:30am for hours. 6:30pm bedtime because she was so tired. So she could sleep from 630-130 = 7hrs. 6am was morning, minus 7hrs she would sleep for, gave us a bedtime 11pm. The idea is for a few nights stay up until 11pm. Yes it will be horrible. Then gradually move bedtime forward in increments to a more reasonable time. We couldn't quite hack 11pm but did 9:30pm and then gradually snuck forward to 8pm. If we put her to bed much earlier she's up in the night again. She sleeps in later doing this later bedtime, until 7am usually."

I have a reception child and a Y3 and itâ€™s very hard to keep them occupied, although my Y3 is at least able to get on with school work on his own for longer periods. 

My son in reception enjoys cosmic kids yoga, and is very keen on doing his â€˜workâ€™ on the iPad - we do try to limit this but have found Crazy Cursive (app) and Phonics Bloom (website - phonics games) to be at least vaguely educational and they hold his attention for longer periods when we need to help his brother. 

Otherwise weâ€™re doing a lot of handwriting practice. He enjoys practising his letters in sand and on wipe clean books. Also chalk on a blackboard. I remember being told that doing sensory writing helps their muscle memory. Weâ€™ve written a couple of (very short) letters to his friends and had exciting replies. He does the White Rose maths videos as well and we always end up getting out teddies/buttons on plates etc to recreate the activity so that takes up a bit of time. We get other schoolwork home but nothing great heâ€™ll concentrate on for more than max 15 minutes at a time.

I buy it in massive tubs for about Â£16-  Â£20 for nearly 485g (Â£4.16 per 100g maximum if I can only find it at Â£20 per tub) If you are only buying it in 50g or 75g tubes you are probably paying between Â£8-Â£10per 100g, almost double the price per g. If you use a lot of it you should definitely get a tub!

4158557,First psychiatrist appointment ,am_i_being_unreasonable,2021-02-07 10:08:02.000 +0000,"I second EMDR. I had repeated childhood traumas (sexual and physical abuse, neglect) and trauma later in life. I have seen a number of psychiatrists over the years but none of them were interested in trauma, they were only interested in diagnosis and medication - neither of which helped. In fact, a diagnosis made it worse because whatever I was feeling was attributed to bipolar disorder and my traumatic history was swept under the rug.

It is only in the last couple of years, since having psychodynamic therapy, that I have begun to experience fewer depressions. I have just started EMDR after reading The Body Keeps the Score, which I would recommend to anyone who has experienced trauma. [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Body-Keeps-Score-Transformation-Trauma/dp/0141978619/ref=nodl_?tag=mumsnetforu03-21]] I tried to receive it on the NHS but they told me EMDR is only for â€˜traumatised peopleâ€™ which sums up their wilful ignorance of my history.

A psychiatrist may try to diagnose you with EUPD but be aware that there is a lot of controversy around this diagnosis, as it is often seen as a catch-all for people - particularly women - who grew up with trauma and thus rather invalidates their unique experiences. They may try to prescribe you antipsychotic medications like quetiapine or resperidone which can cause debilitating side effects such as weight gain or cognitive issues, and there is a lack of evidence to support their usefulness in trauma. Do read up on anything they offer very thoroughly so you can make an informed decision on whether medication is the right option for you.

There is a lot of evidence to support EMDRâ€™s effectiveness in treating trauma and there are many people who make a full recovery after treatment. You also arenâ€™t required to go into detail about the trauma, unlike other therapies that can involve talking about the trauma over and over, which is potentially retraumatising.

Good luck OP. Remember that none of this means there is something â€˜wrongâ€™ with you or that you are mentally ill. You are experiencing an understandable response to multiple traumas. The numbness you describe sounds like dissociation."

I'm 36 and have suffered my whole adult life except for 2yrs after my first lot of accutane. Firstly, your dose doesn't sound that high. I was only on it 6months but I was on 80mg for much of that - I weigh 9stone. If the dose doesn't go high enough then I've heard that can be a reason for it not working. 
As I said though, mine came back eventually. The single biggest effect on my skin is carbs and sugar. Have you tried doing a keto diet? If not I highly recommend it. I don't do full keto - I still eat lots of veggies but avoid starchy ones like potatoes, butternut squash, sweet pot etc. So it's more low carb than no carb. I do still have dairy which I find is ok as long as carbs are low but you've gotta make sure you're having the full fat stuff. Also try and eat regularly, don't skip meals and snack on nuts to keep your blood sugar level even all day.

1. The liver ^can^ recover, even from serious abuse.
2. Women in general cannot survive as much alcohol abuse as men.
Thinking you're going to die soon is an excuse to keep drinking. Shake it off.

So the best time to start is now.  On my 'last day' I actually chose not to drink. I was seriously ill and going to see the GP the next day. I knew I could drink and it wouldn't really make any difference to the outcome, but it mattered to me.  You can decide whether or not to drink today, but if you're planning to try and stop in secret, I can guarantee the decision you make today will shape how you get on.

However, my top tips would be:
1. Do not try and stop in secret. Speak to your GP.  If she/he wants blood tests doing, do them. (You also know that the bloods can come back looking relatively normal even when the damage is quite severe).
2. Do not try and stop in secret. Tell your friends you are stopping. You can call it Dry January to start off with, or [[https://www.oneyearnobeer.com/ One Year No Beer]].
3. Do not try and stop in secret. Seek help.  The right form of help is up to you.

And then beyond that - make sure you anticipate your triggers.  Be watchful for them, plan ahead. They may be unexpected. (As I've said on here many times, one of mine was getting off the bus, because I associated it with getting home from work, which meant it was wine o'clock).  Keep your hands busy - crafting, gaming, something to occupy you to stop you getting bored and restless.

For me the book that helped me was [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beat-Booze-comprehensive-combating-problems-ebook/dp/B003Q6CX0A/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&tag=mumsnetforu03-21&qid=1609670927&sr=8-1 this one]].  Get one of the ones you've been recommended today, on Kindle (you don't need an actual Kindle device to read one) and you can make a start.

It is impossible to regret giving up alcohol. You might think 'oh I missed out on x' or 'y would have been more enjoyable' but in the fundamentals, in the things that make your life, none of them are better because of alcohol.

This is hard work but it's better than dying of alcoholic liver disease."

Neither of them went tremendously well, and I would probably benefit from sitting down with an absorbing book to de-stress â€“ but I fear that reading time is the thing thatâ€™s going to be squeezed over the next few weeksâ€¦

*Keith* (or rather, *Viking*) Thanks for the suggestion of *Railhead* - that looks really interesting (although probably a bit old for DS at the moment, as you said). We are actually members of the Calibre audio library but had let it lapse a few months ago â€“ time to start borrowing again, I think!

Love the plums/icebox parody *Satusuki* (and good to have you back!) [grin]

*Fortuna* yikes, 45 hours is quite a commitment! I do normally listen on something between 1.1 and 1.5 speed (depending on how brisk or turgid the narration is), so hopefully it will be doable in less than that. Iâ€™m definitely tempted now â€“ it sounds like the ideal way to pass the time while cleaning the kitchen or tidying up.

Thanks also for the incredibly generous offer!

Iâ€™d love any CDs you have that arenâ€™t already on that collection, though â€“ thank you!

*LadybirdDaphne* thanks for a very interesting review of *Inventing Ourselves* [smile].

*Stokey* Cressida Cowell is a great suggestion, thank you â€“ I think DD (7) has already read one of the HTTYD books, and it would be great to have a series than can be enjoyed by both DCs at once. What a great thread this is for getting ideas!

*ChessieFL* DD watched a Brownies panto last month that had Anna McNuff in it â€“ I think sheâ€™s some sort of ambassador for the Brownies. Her books sounded interesting but she came across as a bit self-consciously wacky, so I wasnâ€™t sure about getting one. Itâ€™s good to have your take on it!

*Razorstorm* welcome! I read *Chasing the Dram* last year as I am also a whisky/Scotland fan. It was a very light read but I also learned quite a bit, especially about blended whisky (about which I knew nothing!).

I'm really slacking - must try and find some time to write reviews of my first couple of books as you're all putting me to shame!"

I also notice that if I use Epsom salts in the bath and soak my hair too, it comes out looking thicker. If I then put conditioner on the tips of my hair, it doesn't look too dry.

For pale thinning brows, I brush on a matt brown shadow which is a softer look than brow mascara.

Best foundation I've found for pale dry skin, after years of looking and trying all price ranges, is Rimmel Lasting Finish which often gets compliments and looks very natural, almost like tinted moisturiser but with greater staying power."

The NHS advocates for the 'watchful waiting' approach - but I do know schools and many medical providers have been a little indoctrinated in to thinking that the only path is positive 'affirmation'. We have seen a 4000% rise in girls wanting to become boys in the last 5 years; some say that it's because being trans is more acceptable so that it's now more public, but others see it as being another form of female self-hatred - ie cutting and anorexia.  My belief is that this is socially contagious - are there other kids she knows who are doing this? Can you look through her internet browsing history to see what she has been looking at? 

First port of call I would suggest is Bayswater - [[https://www.bayswatersupport.org.uk https://www.bayswatersupport.org.uk]]
They will offer support and might have a list of counsellors in the U.K. which will help with going deeper in to the root cause of the problem.

I would take heart in the fact that since the Keira Bell High Court ruling puberty blockers can't be prescribed to under 16s - and under 18s without a court order.  This gives you some time. 

[[https://www.transgendertrend.com https://www.transgendertrend.com]]/ is another great resource.

 If you want to try pure manga (which is usally in black and white with sections read in a particular order) then Fruits Basket is a very funny, cute series with nothing ""adult"" in it(there are also animated series too), Naruto is also very popular as are Fairy Tail and Kuma, kuma,kuma Bear."

4154545,Five year old for an oldie novice?,the_tack_room,2021-02-04 15:32:21.000 +0000,"Hi OP,  I only started riding at 45 (almost 3 years ago). I just took to it like a duck to water and loved the horses, Iâ€™d never really been about horses before that. I bought my first horse almost 2 years ago but was mis-sold a horse with Kissing Spine `(she passed a 5 stage vetting but had issues the minute we got her home and we found the cause months later!), I really had no clue what I was doing! I was never able to ride her. She had to be retired. I couldnâ€™t send her anywhere else as Iâ€™d taken her on as my responsibility and I loved her and didnâ€™t want anyone trying to make money from her (like the dealer Iâ€™d bought her from).

Thankfully I ended up on an amazing yard with a super supportive yard owner/trainer.  My husband also rides. So we bought a second horse, older (14), but a warmblood competition horse. Heâ€™s been fantastic, I adore him. Heâ€™s super forgiving re mistakes but can be spooky and has been a challenge, had a few falls (rider error) but heâ€™s really a dream and has been great for us.

Then, as my husband and I wanted to be able to ride together, we bought an Irish Sports Horse last summer. We wanted a younger horse as I didnâ€™t want to end up, in a few years time, with three old horses all at the same time, we were really looking for one about 10 years old, but he had only turned 7 but with an old head on his shoulders. Heâ€™s mainly hunted though, so needs schooling brought on which happens with the help of yard owner/trainer. Heâ€™s a more straightforward, less spooky ride than our other gelding despite being younger. He was Kevin the teenager on the ground when we got him but really good now.

The points Iâ€™d make to you are:
It takes work to keep even a good horse good, our warmblood doesnâ€™t have a bad bone in his body but heâ€™s used to more advanced riders. We have plenty lessons (a few a week) on both geldings to keep warmblood good and to bring on the ISH. And where required, where issues need resolving, I pay for trainer to school them for a bit. You need to make sure youâ€™ll have plenty support.

Re letting one you get be used in lessons, you would have to be so careful re this as you donâ€™t want negative input. I wouldnâ€™t let anyone ride ours who isnâ€™t at least as good as us, no way. Itâ€™s hard enough for non-advanced riders to keep horses good in terms of behaviours, attitudes, and aptitude.

I really think a very young horse would be a bad move.

Lastly, re your canter fear, Iâ€™ve also had canter issues previously. Iâ€™d really recommend a therapy such as NLP to help with that, you could be doing that just now when youâ€™re unable to ride ðŸ˜Š Iâ€™d recommend this one:

So to summarise, itâ€™s a massive learning curve and challenge in all ways no matter how good and suitable the horse, so really make your life as easy as possible. Get an older educated horse. Itâ€™s meant to be fun ðŸ˜Š"

4160802,Crippling Health Anxiety,_chat,2021-02-09 16:41:11.000 +0000,"I hear you, I get it as well. It's exhausting.

The best way forward is to begin to create strategies to manage it. And trying to understand where it comes from.

For me -- and this is just a personal observation as it's different for everyone -- the health anxiety is a manifestation of a deeper and more general feeling of low self-worth. When I was little I was often yelled at by parents and teachers and I developed a paranoia about 'getting it wrong' in general terms. I find myself double- and triple-checking ^everything^ in everyday life. I also had a mother whose default emotional position was 'the world is a dangerous place'. Around my mid 30s this somehow transferred to health stuff -- ^what if I've mistaken this utterly ordinary thing for a terrible disease?^ is basically the thought process.

Over the last five or six years I've diagnosed myself with bowel cancer, heart failure, a brain tumour, schizophrenia, kidney cancer, mouth cancer, and goodness knows how many others.

Importantly as a diagnostician I have a zero percent success rate and despite my terrible predictions here I still am, buggering on. <waves fake stethoscope, uselessly> I'm a bit fat and I've got IBS and that's it.

With me it's definitely triggered by feelings of low self-worth. This year has been especially difficult because being locked away I feel completely invisible. And yes worthless. So naturally I --obsess over-- focus on those little bodily tweaks and twinges more than I otherwise would. It's almost like subconsciously I think I 'deserve' to get ill because my self-worth is so low.

However, I do try to tackle it. Being aware of the fact that when I'm worrying about health, I'm actually replaying aspects of the way I was treated as a child can be very helpful in taking some of the sting out of the worry.

The other thing is that Google (and other search engines) simply make things 100x worse. So I highly recommend never Googling anything health related! Google prioritises things that it thinks people will want to click on ('cos that's how it makes money). People tend to click on frightening-sounding pages about serious illness and so ^bibbety-bobbety-boop!^ Google ranks these kinds of pages higher. This can lead us to think that what is actually quite a rare illness is more likely, because Google's just listed it as the top of a search. But actually all it means is that lots of other worried people have already clicked on the link and read that article.

Having a chat with your GP is definitely a good plan. They won't automatically put you on medication but it might be an option if you and the GP decide to go that way together.

I can also recommend a book called [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Overcoming-Health-Anxiety-David-Veale/dp/1845298241/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&crid=3LJTPH9I27MJQ&keywords=overcoming+health+anxiety&sprefix=overcoming+health%2Caps%2C140&tag=mumsnetforu03-21&qid=1612887745&sr=8-1 Overcoming Health Anxiety]] in addition to any strategy you decide upon with your doctor."

(I still can't be bothered with that, I top water).

Apparently a hydrogen peroxide solution is very good for getting rid of them, but I've not tried it.  

I bought some yellow sticky trap things (a bit like fly paper, [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?ref=nb_sb_ss_sc_3_17)&crid=TC3WMO1L0LY&sprefix=fungus+gant+traps%2Caps%2C152&k=fungus+gnat+traps+dual+yellow+sticky+in+bee+shaped&tag=mumsnetforu03-21]] that you stick in the soil and they catch them as they start to fly.  They aren't the prettiest thing in the world, but they seem to work fairly well.

 - the mental load thing is a huge one IMO. Constantly worrying about how people perceive you, worrying about not being taken seriously by medical professionals etc. I went to a talk given at a black professional network and the question came up of the 'burden' that successful women face in that as well as being brilliant, they also have to raise other black women up as well. Certainly, women in my family were constantly on the go with community meetings, charity work, on top of busy jobs, with little time for just sitting down for a rest, never mind exercise and wellbeing. The 'black excellence' mindset is both a blessing and a curse.

I also think that generational trauma is huge for us as black women. So many of our parents/grandparents went through real trauma in the severe racism they faced and how hard they had to struggle in the early days over here. Not to mention even worse trauma a few generations before that. This sometimes isn't talked about in families, which can be really damaging. I've encountered a stoic attitude and unwillingness to engage in therapy because they're so used to life being hard. I think this has a huge impact on our mental health.

 - I agree that exercise can be such a white space. I live in S London and it can be rare to see black women running. There are some brilliant groups trying to change this - FlyGirl Collective, We Run We Eat (podcast) and lots of online influencers. It's so important to see others who look like you exercising. I was SO self conscious at school about my figure (classic big bum/hips) because there were few people who looked like me. As I've got older I'm much more accepting and learning to exercise for general health and wellbeing, not to fit an external beauty standard, but it took years to develop confidence in gym classes where white girls would see me as a 'before picture'."

4096746,When to start the adoption talk (age 3),adoptions,2020-12-04 01:24:54.000 +0000,"I tell ds it doesn't matter at all that he didn't grow in my tummy *to me*. 

But be prepared it may matter to little one at times, and he may feel it is significant. I had to allow my ds to feel that way and express it (he is 10 now). Because me saying a lot that 'it didn't matter' that he wasn't born from my tummy, was hard for him.

Most of the time it is just a fact, I am mum, and dad is dad and he doesn't mention it. But for our little ones it is a factor of life to deal with and to be able to talk about openly. I find now, when we do talk, I am more likely to feel upset!

Does your little one have a life story book? Did you adopt in the UK?

We use the term birth mum, or her name. Birth father or his name. He wasn't that close to birth father, if he had been I might say birth dad. 

If in the UK you may find post adoption support can help with this. 

Depending why he had to leave his birth family you may find Nutmeg gets adopted is helpful later. But it may not be appropriate and your local adoption agency/county council may have a copy you can read before buying.

So, she has a spectacular role model on how to behave to succeed that isn't based around posing in underwear, mouth agape, like some 1970s throwback. 

Her mum also wrote this book, which I haven't read, but I am guessing there isn't a chapter about thrusting your tits (oops bosom) and ass (s'cuse me, derriÃ¨re) to get ahead.

Audible subscription/ vouchers (can link up with Kindle ebooks, so you get the audio too).

Good wireless earbuds to listen to said audiobooks whilst walking

I know you said no kitchen implements, but I have bought myself a danish dough whisk, as used in Nigellaâ€™s recent programme. That will bring me happiness, as bread cookery is what I experiment with to relax, rather than everyday family cookery.

In addition I would also:
1. Check the loft.
2. Change all exterior lock barrels for the anti-snap, anti-bump type (Easy to do yourself but you need to remove handle first to check you get the right size). If you aren't DIY-ers, get a locksmith in.

3. Whilst waiting for locks to be changed, assuming doors open inwards, put a door wedge so that the doors can't be opened from outside.
4. Hang a windchime behind the door so that, if you do have an intruder, you will hear someone come in.

Some of these are showing longer delivery times on amazon. I would recommend calling your local independent bookshop with a list if the books you want, they can normally get books with a few days - much faster than amazon.

Also, if you can go your local independent bookshop or library and browse I would bet money they have a better choice than online as trained librarians and book sellers are often much more conscious about trying to provide a balanced selection of books than online sellers.

There are a few- some with white and some with black children as main character- I think they are nice as a set as you get the mix. Also showing empowerment at a very basic level.

My husband is mixed race and I am white- our boys 'look' white but have a back grandparent and black cousins so it's so important to us that characters they are exposed to replicate their family. "

4109226,Where can I start to find out more about nutrition for a vegan family?,vegan,2020-12-18 19:03:56.000 +0000,"If you need info about vegan nutrition, you start with a nutrition book and the best is without a doubt this one Becoming Vegan: Comprehensive Edition: The Complete Reference on Plant-based Nutrition  
[[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Becoming-Vegan-Comprehensive-Reference-Plant-based/dp/1570672970?tag=mumsnetforu03-21]] 

Givent the complexity of each of your needs, I am not sure how you can make this work in a healthy way. 
Low fibre - high calories is quite in contradiction with a VEGan diet, unless you abandon whole food and go for crappy vegan junk food, such as vegan cheeses, vegan Frankenstein meat substitute and so on.  Plants have fibre, animals have bones. Unless you use processed grains (white flour, white rice, ...) you will have fibre. Plants are low calories Animal products (cheese, butter, cream, ....) are high calories.  Of course, you have avocado, seeds and nuts, but they are not low fibre. 

Losing weight is quite easy if you stick to the VEG part of vegan, but the soya allergy makes it quite complicated as tofu is a very versatile part for feeding children. 

IN addition to educating yourself on vegan nutrition and which supplement you MUST take , use cronometer.com to see if your nutritional needs are covered. It will give you the numbers for all macro and micronutrients for free. 

You need to understand that the vitamin and mineral in a food isn't the amount your body will be able to use, or absorb. In the case of plant based omega 3, the conversion rate is around 5% so it is very very hard to get your omega 3 from planets . You then have the oxalate in plants that block calcium, and so on. 

Malnutrition is rampant amongst vegan. Many have a 50-shades-of-beige diet. 

Any reason you are considering a vegan diet with low fibre - soya allergy?"

4112755,Weaning,parenting,2020-12-21 22:19:48.000 +0000,"You first need to understand how swallowing works and that is very different from sucking, even from a pouch 
When you suck, the food/liquid is pushed against the roof of the mouth, the palate and from there it goes down. When eating a puree, but even a liquid such as a soup, the tongue needs to push the food towards the back of the mouth and then down. It will take several days to understand this process, so if the food comes out instead of going down , it is absolutely normal. 
Then, you need to make it liquidy until baby figures out he needs to chew. Chewing will produce saliva which will help lubricate the food and let it slide down the throat. Image your self taking a mouthful of mashed potatoes and swallowing without chewing  even once , it will get stuck. But if covered in sauce, far more easy. 

So the first times, prepare your cut veggies this way: cook them in a small pot in 3 cm water at the bottom and let them simmer for 15-20 min, then blend them with whatever liquid is left at the bottom. If during cooking process, too much water evaporates , add more, if too much water is left, remove veggies and add spoonful of water one by one. Blend. 
In France, first food is soup pumpkin soup, pea soup, mix veggies soup and so on. You can then add a bit of parmesan cheese to make it tasty.

4109117,Living with Fibromyalgia,autoimmune_disease,2020-12-17 21:29:33.000 +0000,"I totally understand. I used to be fit and active -ran, did weights, yoga so exercised 6 days a week-suddenly unable to get off the sofa and eventually diagnosed with CFS and then later also fibromyalgia. Itâ€™s been 5 years now & I was just over 40 when I was diagnosed. Sorry if this is long and rambling. My brain doesnâ€™t have the clarity it used to! 

Until I was prescribed gabapentin (which I resisted taking for several months as I was worried about side effects) I used to spend all night rolling from one side of the bed to the other, because even lying in one position would cause so much pain, & DH had moved into the spare room.

I now at least get some sleep and it does help with the pain but I do struggle to work my 20 hours a week, I get home and canâ€™t move off the sofa. I have no life basically. In fact having everything closed is almost a relief because at least now I donâ€™t have to worry that the neighbours are wondering why I never leave the house or do anything.

I did read that eating gluten free relieved symptoms, maybe it does as there are some days when I feel less awful and the pain is certainly less than it was when it first all started.

I also try to pace myself when not at work as I was forever, if I was having a good day, trying to cram all the things in that I couldnâ€™t do on a bad day and end up using all my spoons and then not having enough to get through the next day.
[[https://www.practicalpainmanagement.com/patient/resources/pain-self-management/using-spoon-theory-explain-chronic-pain]]

Itâ€™s hard and the first few years were really bad. I was miserable and very much thinking that my life is over, why me? I think stressing about it caused constant flare ups... which meant more pain ...which caused more stress..... I think gaining a level of acceptance really helped, as did giving up alcohol, I do now even manage to do short yoga sessions on my days off and do feel better just being able to do this for me.
There are times I even manage a walk but not very often I must admit. I am lucky that DH mostly does the hoovering as that leaves me exhausted and in pain but I now have learnt just not to stress if the place does need hoovering because jumping up and doing it could leave me feeling so awful. It can just wait until DH is free.

[[https://youtu.be/BFaXfQpxnps]]

I also ended up with low B12 and now have injections 12 weekly to keep my levels topped up and Iâ€™m on prescription vitamin D  due to deficiencies. There are some small studies that suggest links between low B12 & fibromyalgia and also that Vitamin D can help fibro suffers but the â€˜normal rangeâ€™ for B12 in the U.K. is set very low. In Germany people can buy B12 for self injection in the chemists but we can only get a prescription (although you can seemingly ship it over to the U.K. and self inject if you are desperate. There were some links on a MN thread Iâ€™m sure you could search for if need be)

I also use this at night, 3 pumps of lotion after my shower. [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/BetterYou-Magnesium-Body-Lotion-180ml/dp/B00U6CG5QU?tag=mumsnetforu03-21]]
Low magnesium causes sleeplessness and muscle pain, I feel it helps. Some studies say magnesium helps people with fibromyalgia, others say it makes no difference but when you are desperate you try anything & if it works for me I donâ€™t really care if itâ€™s placebo tbh. 

If I can think of anything else I will pop back on tomorrow. Itâ€™s pretty much bedtime as Iâ€™m exhausted as per usual towards the end of the week."

You can either save and clean jam jars or get some nice little tumblers cheap from the pound shop.

It's also worth saving a bit of the wax mix to top up the candles after they've cooled because you tend to end up with a dippy bit in the middle round the wick.

I was shit at rice too until a friend posted these instructions on Facebook: 
Put a dash of veg oil into a metal pan (youâ€™ll need one with a lid) and use your fingers to coat the inside of the pan with it. Not a lot, just a tiny bit. Put the heat on. After a few minutes add however much much rice you need and stir so it is all coated in the warm oil. After a minute or two add twice as much boiling water as there is rice (so half a cup rice = 1 cup water, etc). The water will get quite excited when it hits the pan! Stir through the rice ONCE then put the lid on and leave to simmer for 10 minutes. Take off the heat and set aside for 5 minutes. Take off lid and stir through ONCE - voila, fluffy rice. Donâ€™t overstir as that will make it mushy."

4087063,Clothes for (slow) jogging in the witner,exercise,2020-12-02 22:44:06.000 +0000,"Gwenhwyfar, I feel your pain!  I'm cold-blooded, too.

Top: I wear one of these [[https://www.mountainwarehouse.com/merino-womens-round-neck-thermal-top-p13371.aspx/black/]] as a base layer (they're wool but I don't find them itchy), with a long-sleeved thinnish running top plus a shower-proof running jacket.  Psychologically, I think the wool makes me feel warmer.

Bottoms: I wear wool tights (everyday John Lewis wool tights, I keep old ones which have holes in for running) underneath normal running leggings.  If it's very cold, I add a pair of running socks as well (depends if your trainers are loose enough).  Alternatively, if I'm not wearing tights but think my feet will be cold, I wear smart wool socks, mine are something like these: [[https://www.smartwool.co.uk/uk/women-s-phd-run-cold-weather-mid-crew-3279.html]].  I find they're fine with mesh trainers.  They're not cheap but they're lovely and warm.

Hands: I think any kind of gloves are fine if they're comfy and keep you warm.  When I'm out, if my hands get hot, stuff the gloves either in a pocket or down my cleavage (ideally remembering to take them out before I go and buy a cup of tea at the end ...)

Head: I like a running head band which covers my ears but doesn't make my head too hot.

Lights: I have some trainer lights like these [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/SAKUUMI-Visibility-Reflective-Exercise-Activities/dp/B07WCNF1SY/ref=pd_lpo_200_t_1/257-4129835-3828506?psc=1&pf_rd_p=7b8e3b03-1439-4489-abd4-4a138cf4eca6&_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_wg=ZeKYh&pf_rd_r=GHH70MPG095KPCQ8R2S0&pd_rd_i=B07WCNCWRY&pd_rd_w=Ni7Fp&tag=mumsnetforu03-21&refRID=GHH70MPG095KPCQ8R2S0&pd_rd_r=04b7e891-620c-4830-8428-c9403d69137a]] which are very good for visibility.

I also find that it helps to get changed half an hour or so before I run and then put thick slippers on until I leave the house so that my feet are warm before I start.  

I really wish I had better circulation and didn't have to wear so many layers, but I guess it would be worse if I weren't exercising."

DHs problems are more long standing. It first started last year and he eventually went to the GP. He also started using Earol and by the time he got to the GP it was nearly better.

 A man who abuses, particularly with violence, is very unlikely to ever admit that he genuinely wants to hurt his victim. But when an abuser says you wind him up, won't do as you're told, do something wrong, show disrespect, wear the wrong clothes, say the wrong thing or whatever crime it is that you're supposed to have committed ... then the abuser is saying that they are ^justified^ in what they do. It's a subtle difference, but the outcome is the same.

They are very unlikely to change.

Inside the minds of angry and controlling men' written by Lundy Bancroft]] the man who wrote it says that after decades of trying to counsel abusers he realised it hardly ever worked.

**I explained that I still loved him and as DDs father, it would be irresponsible for me to encourage her to have a relationship with him until he has sought therapy, understands, is willing to change and move on. **

I'm sorry OP, but the man you love is a mirage. You love the man you thought he was, not who he actually is. You will go through a grieving process similar to if your STBX had died (and it's a good way to explain this dimension of what you're going through). You deserve so much better than the man he's turned out to be.

As for your DD maintaining her relationship with him, where there is violent abuse it's not advisable.

I think you are at the point where some professional support and advice would be very helpful. I think you should try to get back to the police and finish that statement. Many police forces have specialist DV officers who can be really helpful. It might be that they will remove him from the house and you can return. But you would need a non-mol order for that to work (hard to get over Xmas). Plus a lot of courage and support because he will try to worm/threaten his way back in and then of course, if you did allow him back, SS will be involved because you and DD would be in great danger.

WA will help you enormously if you can get through and access them."

A lot resonates with me as a relatively recent revert to Catholicism. I love stories of being drawn to God and of answered prayer. I think converts and reverts have more insecurity about Faith as they dont want to take it for granted and feel the loss of the years where it just didn't matter to them, and wanting to show your faith as best you can but uncertain you can do it right. If that makes any sense to you?

Her fist reaction will be angry and upset. Sheâ€™s hopefully going to calm down when she hears you just want to help your son find the easiest path through.

Meal planning done on a Friday before shopping on Saturday (previously on the shop but due to COVID now all online). Calendar appointments and birthdays etc recorded in family iCal to allow everyone to add their appointments, but also transferred to the weekly fridge board along with reminders for each day e.g. musical instrument, p.e. Kit etc. Children then have to check fridge each day to see what they need to pack and what their activities are for each day.
Essentially, I find I have to deal with stuff as it comes in. Anything put to one side to deal with later usually isn't!

Last night DD 18mo had one of frozen mashed potato (I made loads extra a few weeks ago, added more milk and no salt to hers before freezing portions) plus one of a meat ragu,- 2 onions, carrots, celery sticks, garlic, pack mince fried up then 2 tins of tomatoes added. Made enough for about 16 meals.
To make her meal I literally popped one of each ice cube into her bowl, microwaved it for a minute then left to cool. If we have rice or chips Iâ€™ll give it to her with that but the frozen mash is great.
I also have one full of Jamie Oliver 7-veg tomato sauce which I serve with pasta (or any carbs - she loves dipping buttered toast into it).
If you always have 2 or 3 things in the freezer, you can generally add one to whatever you are having or put one on pasta.
Also If weâ€™ve had a rubbish food day (Mummyâ€™s pizza for lunch...) I add frozen peas / sweet corn to whatever is for dinner. Fruit for snacks. If sheâ€™s picky I grate cheese on anything and sheâ€™ll eat it.
Keep stocked up on fish fingers / veggie fingers too, and potato waffles, some brands have a lot less salt but I canâ€™t remember which."

Whether you meant it to or not this  sounds suspiciously like victim blaming.  No one would ever suspect that they would be subjected to what she was put through. She should be able to go where she wants and do what she wants without being subjected to sexual violence. 

There is a really good book that explains the different ways survivors are blamed when they are subjected to sexual violence. I really recommend it.

Thanks for your reply. Yes she's been referred to SALT after an assessment. Mild understanding & moderate speech issues. Her hearing has been checked and there's no issue there.  She hasn't had any therapy yet as were waiting for an appointment to come through after the initial assessment. Lockdown has understandably slowed everything down. 

When I met with her nursery school teacher before Christmas she said quite a few parents had commented on speech delay and they think it'll be common with lockdown. Hopefully as more things open up that will help. The school have sent some homeschool activities so it's great to have new ideas and she's really enjoying doing these and showing them to her dad when he gets home from work & talking about them.

I'll definitely check out the book. I used the oh crap potty training book a couple of months ago and it worked well. It helped with understanding the how her brain was interpreting everything.

Hopefully her behaviour is just another phase but I want to nip it in the bud ASAP

A pp has mentioned therapy and if you can afford it, I definitely try to find a good therapist to deal with the fall-out of all youâ€™ve experienced. You should be able to get help on the NHS, but it may not be easy.

Meanwhile, Iâ€™d start really small. Sometimes these suggestions sound trite, but ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸ Waking up and opening your laptop sounds so miserable. What about leaving your laptop for ten minutes and going to make a hot drink and try to start the day just slightly differently? Some little new routine. Take your coffee to the window or similar. Thatâ€™s just a tiny first step that might feel more possible than take a shower/go for a walk etc which I know can feel impossible. 

Thereâ€™s some really helpful books you could look at to try to shift your perspective, which is totally understandably negative at the moment. One of the Russ Harris books,  The Reality Slap and/or The Happiness Trap.

It is brilliant. Small household - single parent, teenage DC and a short-haired cat. My teenager loves gadgets so took responsibility for all the set up - machine and apps.  I reckon the 1st weekend it did our landing (carpet) and bathrooms (vinyl) 10 times. It picks up so much pet hair, dust, bits. It is easy to use and clean. I really love using it in the kitchen (ceramic tiles) - it has a quick 30 min programme. 

For a laugh I took it over to my mum's house (support bubble). She has been unwell and struggles to hoover properly. So we set EUFY running upstairs and and I hoovered downstairs. It did brilliantly and she (in her 80s) is so tempted to get one. I do worry about her tripping on it. 

The only downside is that my teenager's plans to make a fortune on youtube from cat/robovac videos are not going well [grin] [grin]. Cat hates it!!"

4159982,Fussy eater at 22 months ,breast_and_bottle_feeding,2021-02-09 20:54:39.000 +0000,"All the food he eats have sweetness in common *bread, plain pasta, various fruit, yogurt,crackers, soft cheese and breadsticks* 

We humans are animals of habits, we like what we know and repetition will consolidate feelings. 

I am not sure having the ""safe"" (and safe from what ?) food is helping. 

What I suggest you try is this: 
For a week - and I know he has a sister so you need to talk to her and tell her she is part of a secret plan - hide all the sweet biscuits, crisps, chocolate, and even the crackers and breadstick, they are as processed as they get.
During that week, change the meal dynamics, don't make them about him. Don't try to offer new stuff with that body/face language which is worried from the start he won't like it.  Make family meals about family. Change the settings, so if you usually eat in the kitchen , clear the dinning table and set the table for all of you. Move a chair to make room for his high chair or put a booster on a normal chair. All of you sit together, without making a fuss about him eating or not, Maybe during that week, don't make ""one pot "" dishes such as stew or pies , but have a chicken breast, a schnitzel, a battered fish (all possibly homemade to wean him for the processed food taste and additives if he has any) , and next to it, a couple of potatoes, and some veggies, but single. Also consider taste. Make your vegetables delicious using extra virgin olive oil, coarse salt, fresh herbs. Consider slicing a pumpkin and roasting it with garlic, fresh rosemary, salt and oil. 

It is not a punishment, it is adding stuff and new taste. Even the yoghurt, if he usually has a sweet tasting one, have good quality real plain yoghurt, to which you can add a bit of jam, with some  frozen berries which you let melt and simmer in a small pot on the stove. 
For breakfast, move away from sweet cereals (cheerios) and other processed food. You can make pancakes one morning (250 flour, 3 eggs, 1 tbls oil, pinch of salt, 500 ml milk)  or even a homemade cake. The problem is the processed food, even seemingly innocent food such as crackers and breadstick. 
You need to increase the variety, even if he won't touch it. Let the home family have different food every day, a wider variety of vegetables on the table, go for new food, such as homemade meatballs in tomato sauce. 
Have the meal together and try to ignore him, and focus on a family chat, talking about plans, don't ask "" do you want to try"" or "" see if you like it"" or "" you want something else"" . Just leave the dish in the middle of the table and put a spoonful in your plate, your daughter's , then your son, before moving to serving your husband. Sit down, say enjoy, and start eating and talking about a radio talk, your sister's cat or whatever, but the food or him eating/liking it. Talk about going to the park later or making some craft.  Have your daughter say at some point "" this is nice, mom"" . Show him everyone is eating it, have some, enjoying it. 
While you cook and prepare food, have him with you, standing on a chair put safely against the kitchen top (with back of chai\r against furniture) and while you cook, nibble here and there, take a bite of ham, dress your tomato salad and then talk ""hum.... what does it need, a bit more salt /parsley, basil....,"" and have him add a pitch, mix, taste again and say ""perfect ""

When it comes to fussy eating  you need to take action on two fronts, the meal times dynamic and increasing the variety at the table. This mean that for a week, you don't cave in and jump to offer alternatives. 

Do some reading . I strongly recommend this book

*Brassica* give yourself time. Exercise could well be masking your weight loss, especially if you have any delayed onset muscle soreness which is associated with water retention. KOKO and the whoosh fairy will head your way soon enough.

*Ouchmyfeet* I've been eating this way for seven years and I still add electrolytes to my water. [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00SP31TCW?ref=ppxpopmobapshare I buy these cheap ones from Amazon]] because artificial sweeteners don't agree with them. I had to have blood tests recently and my sodium levels were actually on the low side of normal so even though I feel like I'm adding a lot of salt to my food I must need it. I think a lot depends on the other foods you eat. I eat a very clean diet so I need the added salt. If you're eating more processed foods or cured meats then you might not need to keep adding electrolytes. Also if you're drinking excessive amounts of water and other fluids then you will be flushing electrolytes from your system that you will then need to replace. [[https://www.gundersenhealth.org/health-wellness/eat/are-you-over-hydrated/ Here's an article about over-hydration.]].* It also depends on how quickly you drink fluids. If you down a pint of water in one go then most of it will end up as urine - taking electrolytes with it. You need to drink continuously through the day. Alternatively if you're drinking water with added electrolytes like the ones I linked to, then more of it is absorbed so you can drink it much more quickly - useful if you only have limited opportunities to drink through the day."

However from a weight loss point of view it won't make much difference apart from inflammation potentially contributing to water retention. Saturated fats such as butter, lard, dripping and goose fat are all fine to cook with. Although in fact, every one of the fats and oils I've mentioned are made up of different combinations of monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and saturated fats. For example lard contains more monounsaturated fat (widely regarded as healthy) than saturated fat (widely regarded as unhealthy.) The whole demonisation of saturated fat is completely made up and has been thoroughly debunked by journalist Nina Teicholz in her book [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/192522810X/ref=cmswrcpapifabcBXccGbMA02ZXV The Big Fat Surprise]] which is a brilliant read. Anyway, in short --I know, too late-- it's the ^proportion^ of omega-3 and omega-6 in your diet that's important. We want to tip that towards a healthy ratio by emphasising animal fats, monounsaturated fats (oil, avocado, nut) and fish oils, while minimising vegetable oils. So at home I don't use vegetable oils but I don't worry too much about what my food is cooked in for takeaway/restaurant meals because I know most of my fat intake is from healthy fats.

At the end of the day, I regard the fact that human body fat is 30% saturated as proof that saturated fat cannot be unhealthy. If it was unhealthy then why would we store so much of our body fat as saturated fat? There's actually a school of thought that implicates polyunsaturated fats as a major driver of the obesity epidemic, and not simply a consequence of carbohydrate consumption. After all, many primitive cultures ate high carbohydrate diets without suffering from obesity and diabetes, or even tooth decay."

Why the berries?  Not allowed in the first two weeks of Bootcamp!  I'm also not sure why you're using Quark, as this is a low fat product - remember this is a high fat way of eating.

^BIWI I heard you on the Mosely zoom chat - you're such a cuddly speaker!^

Not quite sure what that means, but thank you!  (I think?!) [grin]. Agree though, MM did go on a bit.  But I suppose zoom calls are unscripted and he didn't know what he was going to be asked - that's quite unusual, because when we've had webchats before, people post their questions in advance.  And I suppose if he'd had to type his answers, rather than speak, they would have been shorter.



Sorry.  It wasn't meant to be hate for vegans [grin]. Just the insistence/proselytising about veganism being the healthiest way to eat - which is patently can't be if you're eating so much processed food (even before you consider the potential lack of important nutrients) - and that it's healthier for the planet, when some practices clearly aren't!  

I think you're quite right when you say you haven't been eating enough fat - being hungry is a tell-tale sign!

 

I'm with you - I really, really, really love cheese.  And butter.  And yoghurt. 
 And eggs!  I love vegetables and pulses/legumes, and could - at a push - eat a mainly vegetarian diet.  But I just can't see how a totally vegan diet would be enjoyable.  For me.



^Hoping that as a veggie, almost vegan, this WOE is going to work for me. Having a few doubts now but I haven't had any problems so far so going to stick with it and hope all of my efforts pay off.^

It will work for you!  Possibly a bit slower, because if your diet is mainly vegetables then your carb count is inevitably going to be higher than if you were eating meat or fish.  Rose Elliott has created a [[low carb vegetarian diet, which you might want to explore - she's also written a [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Vegetarian-Low-Carb-Diet-Cookbook-vegetarians/dp/0749926988/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=rose+elliot+low+carb+vegetarian+recipes&tag=mumsnetforu03-21&qid=1611305775&sr=8-4  recipe book to go with it, which has some lovely recipes  ]].  Have you checked out the vegetarian recipe in the Low Carb Bootcamp topic?  There are lots of great ideas in there.

^When should the sugar cravings start to subside, do you all think?^

Any time now, I should think!  You should find that by the time we finish the first two weeks of Bootcamp that you're having fewer and fewer cravings, although that does depend on how much of a sugar fiend you were beforehand.  Once you're used to low carbing, and haven't been eating fruit/desserts/sweets/biscuits/chocolate on a regular basis, that your tastes change.  I remember when Cadbury brought Wispa back again, and I rushed out to buy one as I used to love them - but it was like eating a mouthful of sweet, bubbly wax!  I was shocked.  These days, if I eat chocolate I much prefer dark chocolate --although I seemed to manage to put away a fair few Cadbury's Roses at Christmas!--"

This is true but unlikely. I've just ordered from Sweden. No tax on item, so 20% cheaper then tax payable on entry into UK.

I guess it depends on the increased cost of doing business with the UK combined with profit margins and volume of sales.

A smaller company is likely to charge more for goods shipped to the UK as they have smaller volumes, possibly smaller profit margins and the increased costs are a larger percentage of their margins.

If you don't have a Prime, I'm sure you can sign up to a month's free trial, just make sure you cancel it immediately after so that you don't get charged next month.

I got my children to spend 10mins on this each day (I also bought the divided by pack) and within 12 weeks my twins knew all their times tables up to 12 x 12 off by heart. This was in year 3. Building on this knowledge within 6 months my son knew all his times tables up to 20 x 20 off by heart and my daughter up to 18 x 18. In year 3 they were at the top of the school. Not because they were maths genuises but because they had a good grounding in understanding how to quickly work out the answers.

If you shop around I bet you can find a smaller set for closer to ten - I just linked to give an idea. My DD had these and adored them, and they are a toy that lasts really well and is good for quite a wide age range, so they would be good for your friend's eco principles.

Alternatively, maybe packs of seeds for him to plant? Depends on him/his mother - if she won't thank you for another job there's no point! But my brother gave DD packs of seeds one Christmas when she was rising two, and she was delighted and did understand that what grew was 'hers'. 

Or a bird box/bird feeder? Same caveats about not giving the parents another job apply, but if they might like it, it could be put up by his window/somewhere he can see, so he can feel it's 'his'?"

Eleven-year-old Ethan Myles is having a bad day: His summer holiday has been cancelled, the weird glowing crystal he found in the garden has given him an electric shock, draining him of enjoyment, and his mum is suffering from a terminal illness.
If that wasnâ€™t bad enough, heâ€™s only got minutes to stop a race of strange watery beings, led by evil ice-man, Doctor Freeze, sucking the fun from humanity, leaving the entire human race in the darkness of everlasting misery.
Will Ethan and his nine-year-old sister Amber manage to defeat Doctor Freeze before itâ€™s too late, or will all human pleasure cease to exist?

The new world of litter is amazing to me.  So much has changed in 15 years!  I've just ordered a top entry litter tray, which I'm sure never existed when I got my last cat.  A litter locker is also totally new to me!  That's really useful - thank you.  I may just see how we get on but have this as an option.

My old cat only used to eat dry food and this one's on wet food, so I imagine the poo is pretty pongy!  My old cat could clear a room with a fart though! [grin]

4091379,My 6yo is not a nice person,behaviour_development,2020-12-05 18:26:33.000 +0000,"I wouldn't exactly say that your DD is ""not a nice person"", more she is a child with social skills difficulties. The smile is not insolence (although it is probably the most infuriating thing she could do!) it is a sign of panic and trying to keep control. Yes, I've seen that smile myself (I might even have worn it sometimes [smile])

You're right that pulling her up might not achieve much and punishing her often is likely to send her further along the spiral. One thing to do is to recognise and react positively to every bit of pro-social behaviour - every bit of kindness or politeness or co-operation or obedience - that she achieves when you're around to see it. Because these behaviours are not easy for her. So in addition to getting her to report on kindness, you can help her by noticing them and labelling them for her.

She is showing a mix of troubles. There's a book I like called [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Unwritten-Rules-Friendship-Strategies-Paperback/dp/B00IGYN2O8/ref=pd_lpo_14_img_1/257-7860081-1947415?psc=1&pf_rd_p=7b8e3b03-1439-4489-abd4-4a138cf4eca6&_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_wg=GVKZ4&pf_rd_r=3D2TVSN9Z1Z79W5QXP9M&pd_rd_i=B00IGYN2O8&pd_rd_w=O1IeL&tag=mumsnetforu03-21&refRID=3D2TVSN9Z1Z79W5QXP9MThe&pd_rd_r=5e79538f-8e34-4c61-b9d8-43963aa66f96 Unwritten Ruls of Friendship]] which takes a look at many different kinds of social difficulties that cdifferent children can have. I like it because it gives exercises that you can do to help your child learn these ""unwritten rules"" of kindness and politeness and develop the positive side of your child's character. Have a look especially at the sections on the Intimidating Child, Born Leader, Pessimistic Child and Sensitive Soul as it sounds as if she has some traits from each of these. 

You might also want to look into communication and de-escalation techniques. Sounds as if you ask her do something, she refuses or is rude, you tell her off, and it all blows up from there and ends in tears and self blame. With some children you can stop trouble before it starts by just not reacting to the first thing she says. Count to 10, then repeat the instruction with the same or fewer words. You might find she just does it (possibly with grumbling but ignore that, you've won). Some kids have a few seconds processing delay and so their first reaction is say ""no"" to an instruction or request. But given that time to process they are able to listen to what you want and put it on their mental agenda. With my son, I used a lot of ""count to three and consequence"" - by the time I'd told him exactly what to do and told him the consequence and counted to 3 he had time to figure it out and decide to do it. ""Will you do it now or in five minutes?"" works for him too, he always says ""five minutes"" but it is so much calmer than telling him to do it right now.

*My thinking at the mo is that I don't necessarily care what she feels about it (in this scenario) but she absolutely will be polite to other people.*

That may work, good if it does. If it doesn't get better you may need to look into deeper difficulties such as autism-spectrum. Not dealing with change and not being aware she is hurting or offending others or not understanding how what she is saying is hurtful... that could (possibly) be ASC."

It is nothing new, since Weston Price already highlighted how crocked teeth , narrow palates, didn't exist before industrial food (white flour, sugar and processed oils) and wrote extensively about it in 1930. 

Dr Li's book is very recent and his food suggestions are easier than some of the Weston Price Foundation. 

Refined food is damaging to health in many more ways than one thinks, beyond what a multivitamin can fix. A wrong diet will change the facial features and even the bone structure. 

Cooking is not hard if your DH is determined and understand that his first role is ensuring health. 

He could try making a chicken schnitzel: 
3 plates with in this order
1 plate with flour
1 plate with an egg mixed
1 plate with bread crumbs.

Cut chicken breast into stripes, and put one at the time first in flout, then egg, then breadcrumbs and lay on a plate. Add extra virgin olive oil in a pan, heat it up a bit, and put the chicken to cook until brown. a tiny bit of salt, put two kitchen papers on a plate and put chicken on top to remove excess oil. 
Later, when accepted you can add some parsley to the bread crumbs. 

Industrial food is not plain, far from it, a ton of additives, salt, sugars, and oils are added to make it very tasty. Yet when a parent prepare a vegetable, many won't do much with it and then wonder why a child doesn't like it. Vegetables need to be dressed, seasoned . There is a big difference between a boiled pumpkin cube and roasted pumpkin in the oven with garlic, fresh rosemary, olive oil and coarse salt cooked a quite high temperature. 
However, a  boiled pumpkin to which one adds good quality butter and salt makes a delicious mash. 

It doesn't take much to make vegetables taste nice. 
It isn't difficult to cook. It does take time, but difficult , nope"
4145467,Toddler refuses to eat homecooked food or try anything new,parenting,2021-01-25 21:11:48.000 +0000,"I think you and your DH should have a conversation about what you think should be the best diet health wise for your son, what you would like him to eat and accept that both of you have been lazy in that department.
If you really want to change what your son eats, and move away from high processed, highly transformed, artificial and highly palatable food and opt for a diet rich of fresh fruit and vegetables, fresh meat, fresh fish, nutrient (and not additives) rich, you need to accept responsibility and stop making excuses. 

Not knowing how to cook is not a valid argument. Nobody knows how to drive a car before learning to drive. We all learn new things , from how to use a computer, to gaming. 
in 2021, with a zillion YouTube channels dedicated to cooking, blogs, books and so on, if you want learn to cook, you can. Never has it been so easy. 

So, when step 1 (deciding how your son and your family  should eat) is done, step 2 (his eating preferences and habits are your doing) is accepted,  only then can you move to step 3, changing the way he and  you both eat. 

You have shaped your DS's taste buds and gut bacteria towards industrial food, and if you keep that food, while trying to integrate real food, or sneak it, hide it, it will just be a painful-for-all battle, like continue giving cocaine to someone, just less. 

Make home version of the industrial food he is used to eat, and one by one, remove all the others and don't buy them again. Involve him in the buying, cooking of the food. 
Co-habitation of bad and good makes no sense. IF you are determined to do good to your son, educate yourself on real food and the damage of bad.

use after brushing to go around the gumline, it is excellent for getting rid of plaque that toothbrushes can't reach. these really are amazing:

[[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Interspace-Toothbrush-Brushes-Orthodontic-Bridges/dp/B01LQUOWEW/ref=asc_df_B01LQUOWEW/?hvlocphy=1006565&linkCode=df0&hvptwo&psc=1&hvnetw=g&hvadid=310843213580&hvpone&hvlocint&hvpos&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl&hvqmt&tag=mumsnetforu03-21&hvtargid=pla-562027560470&hvrand=14470882074380996745]]

4) Use interdental teepee brushes between teeth

5) also floss

6) oil pulling with coconut oil after brushing once every couple of days for a few minutes, making sure to rinse after. It's great at reaching bacteria that may be hiding between teeth or whatever. 

7) I often rub coconut oil into my gums at night, it's antibacterial and good for gum health, and not bad for the teeth either. Will really help!

Best of luck OP! and don't forget to be consistent.  

Good luck! I know all of this sounds excessive but done in the bath or as often as you can it's easy to keep up with it. I don't always do every step every day but as many as I can remember to do, so most are done every other day at the least."

Elsewhere in the house, there's an Xbox attached to a different tv screen, with the other Xbox controller. In THIS controller it's possible to plug in a wired headset with mic and play with sound.

But with the Xbox controller being used on the Nintendo switch, no wired headphones work. Husband thinks it needs a ^second^ dongle attached to the Nintendo switch, to be able to somehow connect wifi headphones and mic so he can join in with voice chat and not have to yell into the other room.

I read this book a few years ago just after I got divorced and first encountered the world of online dating. Felt a bit like you, a bit alone and like I'd failed at something. I'm absolutely not a self help type person normally but my friend loved it so I gave it a go. This book is hilarious and quite soothing. It's not preachy or relationship advice, just has some good anecdotes and some interesting ways to think about the world and life. 

It certainly made me much more cheerful about life and being single. Worth a read and I think you'll probably resonate with a lot here. "

^Bloody Nora, so now the OP should fart about with a DIY sock come sleep mask in order to pacify nobhead neighbours?! How about the neighbours consider that they 'live near other people and deal with it sensibly'? They live in a cul-de-sac - who is possibly going to derive Christmas cheer from lights flashing on and off outside a house at 2am?^

Well yes, 'farting about', as you put it, with easy fixes to the problem would be the practical way of getting the result you want after all. It would require acknowledging that you live in a built up area among other people who want to celebrate a seasonal holiday in a way that really is quite innocuous.  

Depends though - do you want to get off to sleep or do you want to spit nails all night? The choice is entirely yours.
 
My suggestion is to stop being so furious, stop stubbornly refusing to do what you can to get the sleep you claim to need so desperately, unclench, and do whatever is in your power to do to achieve your aim. 

Standing on dubious principle here and insisting on the other guy doing what you demand isn't going to get you a decent night's sleep, is it?"

My advice to you, more than anything is that you need to relax and follow his feeding cue, the reason he doesn't have any is probably because you're offering the breast before he's fully hungry which could be why he's only feeding for a short time, I would also stop the dreamfeed. Maybe you can keep them for nighttime only if you think his volumes were too low throughout the day? 

I know you're worried about your supply, is there any way you could pump in between? I know he doesn't take the bottle right now, but he may in future once he isn't being pressured, and that way you can relax a bit more ?

I hope I'm not coming across as mean or anything! I'm just trying to type this quickly as I've got to get up with the kids :)

4152812,My Dad Has A Dream.,book_of_the_month,2021-01-31 23:36:18.000 +0000,"Hi Mumsnet. My Dad has a dream, that Iâ€™m trying my best as his daughter, to make come true.

When my brother was 13, he suffered a cardiac rest on our landing floor, in the middle of the night. Itâ€™s safe to say this was the most traumatic thing we as a family could have ever experienced. A few years later, and after one miraculous recovery (for which we are so grateful every day), my Dad, a former plumber, decided to pursue a life-long dream of hisâ€¦ to write a book.

Inspired by what had happened, he put pen to paper (or more like fingertips to keyboard), and wrote a novel based on this life experience, and other strange and awful events that had occurred to various members of his family. My Dad wrote this book on his own. My Dad published this book on his own, setting up his own mini publishing company, Trio Publishing (there are 3 of us kidsâ€¦ get it). He did it all himself, and we are so proud of him. He ordered 5,000 copies, of which we, unfortunately, have around 4,900 still left in boxes around our home. Itâ€™s been devastating to see his dream fail, not for lack of quality as those who read the book have said how great they found it, but purely because he has struggled to bring his book, â€˜The Fearâ€™, to the worldâ€™s attention (at 62, social media is not his greatest friend).

Thatâ€™s where I come in. Iâ€™m his 22-year-old daughter, and am trying to harness the power and positivity of social media to get my Dadâ€™s book out there. I thought, where better than Mumsnet? All I hope for is to see my Dad fulfill his dream of becoming a best-selling author. As a Dad whoâ€™s provided me with so much love and support, this is my way of trying to show, to some small degree, what he means to me.

If you feel like supporting a great man, and a (very) small, local business, â€˜The Fearâ€™ by Mark Cunnington  is available on Amazon and at his own website [[www.triopublishing.co.uk]]

*Linda* not everyone gets carb flu, especially if you're keeping up with your electrolytes. It also depends on what your diet was like before going low carb.

*Gillyweed* are you giving in to the cravings or are you able to muscle through? I always crave crisps at my TOTM so I find the salt and vinegar pork scratchings work well as a low carb substitute. If you crave chocolate then would a high cocoa chocolate work instead? I like the Sainsburys 85% one that comes in individual 25g bars. It's too high cocoa for me to overeat but hits that chocolate craving. Otherwise you could just try and fill up on something else that's low carb. I find a bowl of Greek yogurt with some double cream and maybe a few berries (if we're on to Bootcamp Light) is a good cheerer-upper.

*Crackofdoom* it sounds like you need electrolytes. Try adding a squeeze of lemon juice and salt to your water.

4146850,Maternity legging recommendations,pregnancy,2021-01-26 14:28:12.000 +0000," Sorry to go against the flow but I ordered Love Leggings maternity leggings based on recommendations from Mumsnet and returned them straight away. I loved their 7/8 non-maternity gym/yoga legginings though and have kept those for after the pregnancy. [grin] I am also used to my gym leggings and wearing high-waisted leggings, that are good quality, squat-proof and where you feel ""supported"" but not restricted in any way. 

I think leggings are such a personal taste. I'm sorry to report that, in my experience, Love Leggings ones are nothing like what you describe you are after. Yes, they are super soft and comfortable. The fabric is thick but more similar to sweatpant fabric with fleecey lining on the inside. But they are most definitely not ""structured"", will mark every single tiny bump on your skin and don't offer any support whatsoever. They'd be amazing for lounging on the sofa or sleeping in on a very cold night but that's not what i was after. Also, I'm guessing you're probably a good few weeks away from your bump being generous enough to fill the Love Leggings ones.

To be honest, I've pretty much given up on maternity leggings and have decided instead to just get high-waist leggings in a bigger size that will presumably see e through the postpartum months as well. Many people swear by Lululemon Aligns to take them through the pregnancy and see to fit the bump amazingly well. Apparently they are super comfortable and stretch well over the bump. I didn't want to spend on Lululemon so I've gone with my favourite dupes that you can get from Amazon. I'm currently 26 weeks and very comfortable wearing these ones: [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B083JRHBYF/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?psc=1&tag=mumsnetforu03-21&ie=UTF8]] Black ones seem to be out of stock currently though. I got them at 14 weeks one size bigger than my normal size and I still have room to grow. They're brilliant for the bump as there is a wide waist panel which I find supportive but not restrictive and there is no elastic at the top. I've been using my pre-pregnancy leggings from the same brand until now and only now started feeling like I need extra space. My other recommendation are these leggings: [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0813G9HK3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?psc=1&tag=mumsnetforu03-21&ie=UTF8]] I've just ordered a bigger size to serve as ""maternity"" leggings.

I agree you make some good points about increasing immigration from the developing world (personally I would prefer our efforts went into making  the developing world a better place to live but hay ho) many British asians voted Leave (very shrewdly) with this in mind.

I have to hand it to Cummings, he conducted a masterful campaign, used up to date advertising methods and cutting edge technology to infiltrate and influence people's opinions and views. The Remain campaign was very amateurish by comparison.

Brexit, to me, is testament to the power of clever advertising. There was, of course, no control to be taken back, it was merely a slogan. But people latched onto it. They wanted something to change and saw leaving the EU as way of making change come about. Change is indeed coming, but probably not any sort of beneficial change for the vast majority of people.

[quote earsup]We had one in a holiday rental flat in portugal a few years ago....no instructions, found some tips on youtube but just couldnt get used to it...gave up....ate out !!...it may have been faulty....rings kept going from orange to off ...do they only work once the pan is on the ring...??...[/quote]
 That doesn't sound like an induction hob, they don't light up, they stay black. Could it have been a halogen hob? They too are flat glass but a totally different way to cook and those rings do light up. 

 we were very unsure about it before we did it so we bought a 2 ring portable induction hob and cooked with it for a month before making the decision. We were having a kitchen extension built so knew we would need something to cook on in the meantime. Ours is an Andrew James one but this is very similar [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/VonShef-Induction-Portable-Ceramic-Electric/dp/B0725FT8L8?tag=mumsnetforu03-21 Von Chef]] 

We have had our beautiful induction hob 9 years now, we have never had any issues with it. It was Â£850 at the time we bought it but you can combine cooking zone as we have a large Circulon saute pan that was too big for one cooking zone. Ours still looks brand new. It is a DiDietrich. 

Boils fast, very controllable, easy for the children to lift a pasta pot with hot handles and me not stress about them setting the oven gloves on fire on a gas flame. For the portable one, we have used it outside too in summer."

Has the tongue tie been cut? Are you interested in that as an option at all?

You've done so fantastically to get to 11 weeks on breastmilk alone - that is really, genuinely a phenomenal achievement with a baby who can't latch. A combination of breastmilk and formula will likely be great as it means he gets everything that he needs but you also have some pressure taken off you.

It can feel horrible at first when you've invested so much into getting solely breastmilk, but what I found when we introduced formula to DS2 was that it quickly became just his milk - nothing horrible at all. And it doesn't mean that you will have to stop giving breastmilk. If you want to do both alongside, that's great too.

I don't know if you will have the same reaction as me as well - but I found I quickly replaced the guilt about formula with some kind of desire to ""do formula perfectly"" - it had to be exactly the right, sterile knife, the water measured to the single millimetre, I had a screaming argument with DH because I felt he wasn't respecting the guidelines properly [blush] it can be a fraught time. But it settled down and honestly it was actually quite nice to have some formula around by the time we started weaning (I never, ever thought I'd feel like that) in comparison to DS1's weaning experience. We were also able to wean back to fully breastfeeding again not long after he started solids, because he needed less from the milk side of things."
