You need to do everything you can to show him you're calling the shots now.

Sounds like he's been manipulating you for ages with his moods and tantrums. Time to say ""no more, I'm the one in control now"".

I think that will soon shock him out of any ""emotional crisis"" he might think he's having.

Think about that old no nonsense headmistress when you were small who everyone was in awe of... ""you have behaved in an unacceptable way. I will not tolerate it. What are you going to do about it...""  

at some point in the future you might soften toward him but this is not the time!

She was high temp, very sleepy, not drinking, and eventually just as we were going to A&E had a rash that was not fading under a glass. The hospital gave her a large dose if calpol and Brufen based on her weight that brought the temp right down, which made her feel well enough to start drinking water. The rash was viral. They didn't mind seeing her at all.

Poor poor you - what a worry. If I was in your shoes honey I would ring first thing monday and ask to speak to your consultant. I would want a plan of action - i.e any plan for regular monitoring to see if growth increases etc. I know every case is different and comparisons are not always helpful but I do know that a friend was told her baby was small for dates - had a really stressful pregnancy as she was continualy being monitored etc and when the baby (who ended up being born at 35 weeks) was born he was over 51b inw eight and if had gone to term would have likely been a 8 pounder!! He was also the length her other son was at term. 
I think that the way you have been treated is unacceptable - especially the lost notes which I think is inexcusable. 
Your going to be worried sick over it until something is sorted out - our Midwife Unit has a Midwife Manager person that you can raise concerns to - maybe ask to speak to the equivalent up there? 
Hope that helps - thinking of you - you need to do what is going to make you relax....maybe even a private scan would be worth the money if it reassured you?

But it was a ridiculous garden for two obviously non-gardeners. All that planting seems quite high maintenance for a couple who just want to sit down. At no point did 'pottering around doing gardening' come into their lifestyle. For me, that's a fundamental design flaw. Unless they had told the designer they were planning on paying a gardener!

 He just fits the ""narcissist"" description to a T. Is there anyway of knowing how long this can go on for? Because I think the refuge is sounding like a good idea now. With abuse, people don`t realise how bad it is ^until^ ^they`ve^ ^left^. SO your kids might not want to go, but that might be because they`VE desensitised to his abuse and thats not good. 
 What you`Re describing is really awuful. Holding grudges and witholding love against a 3 year old, and the rest. SamVAk says, this is DANGEROUS to a child. 
 And no, I wouldn`T trust him with your elder daughter. Not because of the lack of sex, that is a different thing that narcissists do to keep their mate `hanging` and frustrated. More of a power thing- not because they don`t want sex. But because apparently every paedophile is a narcissist (not the other way round-not every narcissist is a paedophile). But they don`t see others as real people. SImply as two dimensional pawns in their life. They don`T have empathy so they can`t imagine how other people feel, or if have an idea, they simply don`T care. 
 What he has already done to your daughter counts as sexual harrasment, and is pretty disgusting by human standards. 
 Narcissists are fantastic at ""acting"" and faking emotions. SO when we meet them we feel like we`Ve met our soul mate. But this is the real him, thats it. And it can and will get worse. I would leave to the refuge if I were you. Then you can give yourself some breathing space. If you`re in a mess, you`Re no good to your kids anyway.

- hip dysplasia: to deal with this you need generations of dogs screened and carefully bred. A random mongrel won't be immune to these kinds of problems simply by being a mix of breeds as they affect many breeds.
- haemophiloa: carried through the female line, it can affect any mongrel dog whose mother has the gene. 
- degenerative myelopathy: both recessive and affecting many different breeds. This seems to be so prevalent in some breeds that even purposeful breeding after screening may not manage to get rid of it. So having a mongrel with any of the affected breeds in its pedigree makes it likely to have the gene.",2019-03-07 10:38:01+00:00,3525323,How do you buy a dog,thirty_days_only

This.

*Bellini* I would never condone that type of insult but a Brexiter cannot meaningfully apologise for someone else's insult purely because they share Brexit beliefs.  Because we do not act as one, we don't even know each other, we are individuals (and hence _not a cult_ as you seem to believe).  If you want to see cult-like behaviour, I refer you to the examples given in  *Andante57's* post above, of which there are many more if you cared to look.

I'm personally well ""over it"", because apparently, ""we won"" (who knew? [smile]).  I will ignore people who come in, drop a quick snarky insult out of nowhere then skulk off again.   It wouldn't happen in real life so perhaps this is the only outlet left to them.

You do not need a blood test. This is because your hormones will be all over the place and as you are on HRT it's not going to show your natural levels anyway.

No one needs blood tests for HRT, only sometimes to show if you have any other condition.

My consultant, who I've been with for ages, is offering online consultations, but would I think expect women to see them in person at some stage once it's possible (London area.)

I can tell you now that Louise Newson will offer you estrogen gel and Utrogestan as this is considered one of the best combos.

Your GP could prescribe that if you asked.

The only difference with a private consultant is they have the ability to prescribe outside of the licensed regimes, as they take responsibility, so sometimes this can include lengthening the estrogen-only part of the cycle, reducing the progesterone part, etc.",2020-06-04 15:19:59+00:00,3928825,Terrible anxiety - do I need to see someone?,menopause

Not waking for food. Megan took 5oz at 7pm and the same again at 10.30pm. Settled relatively well in her cot but kept waking and sounding like she was straining. Terrible wind from both ends!! 

I spent from midnight til 2am resettling her everytime she had wind. She would fall asleep with some soothing from me (stroking her head and saying sshhh) but wake again with 5 minutes with more wind.

Gave up at 2am and brought her into bed with me. She fell asleep well on my chest but still kept waking with wind throughout the night. I've no idea how much sleep I got but I was aware of seeing every hour on the alarm clock (plus I don't sleep fully if she's on my chest).

We given infacol (and did again last night). If you saw my earlier post I think it maybe what I ate getting into my breast milk. I threw all the milk away that I had expressed and gave formula for the 10.30pm feed but that obviously didn't improve anything.

223,"Forgive me if this is common knowledge! I'm a FTM and still quite clueless about a lot of things, but I've discovered through trial and error that this works nearly every time to calm my now 7-week-old. Obviously first I rule out the usual - hunger/thirst, nappy, wind, physical discomfort, just needing a cuddle.

I lie her on my lap, facing me, her head on my knees and her legs bent, or round my waist. I take hold of her hands in mine, circling her wrists with my thumb and forefinger, and hold them against her chest/tummy. I don't apply any force, she can still move, she just can't wave her arms round. The rest of my fingers lie on her chest. I suppose this emulates swaddling. Then I lean into her, take a deep breath and say a gentle ""shhhh"" that goes on for as long as I can breathe out. I repeat this until she's calmer. Before long, the crying reduces to the odd whinge, then she's happy or even dozing off.

If you try it, a couple of tips:
 - You need to be calm first, so you can transmit this to the baby. My DH gets more stressed than me when our DD cries, and he struggled a bit, holding her too tight and sh-ing far too impatiently!
 - My DD seems to calm down quickly, then cries again after a couple of minutes. I keep holding and sh-ing, and the crying gets less and less frequent till she stops altogether.

224,Hi! This is my second pregnancy with hashimotos and my levels are always up and down in pregnancy. The guidance is to increase levothyroxine by 25mcg per day as soon as you find out you're pregnant. And also I have blood tests every 6 weeks to check that my levels are ok.

231,"I've just had an argument by text with my friend.  

It started with a very long text from my best friend, ranting on about how she couldn't get a doctors appointment and laying the blame at the feet of the receptionists and calling them interfering biddies.

Basically, she wanted an appointment for today and they couldn't fit her in.  When they enquired what she needed she refused to give them any information (she reckons it's not their place to know and will tell them she will only speak to a doctor).

We go to the same doctors surgery and I have always spoken very nicely to the receptionists and give them as much information as I can about my problem as they very often come up with a solution for me - e.g. I had run out of my pills, thinking I had another packet in the cupboard, no appointments available with doctor or nurse that day so receptionist had the doctor write me a prescription to collect at the front desk, and made an appointment with the nurse for 2 days later to do my blood pressure check.  Problem solved.

I think my friend sees the receptionists as the enemy instead of as a source of information and advice and people who can actually help her.  She also tends to treat the Doctors as an emergency service, expecting to be seen immediately.  

I tried to tell her to be a bit more diplomatic in dealing with the receptionists but she just thinks they are there to answer the phones and book in patients.   I tried to tell her that if she was a bit sweeter in her attitude they would really try to help her, but she was having none of it.

Is it just me who thinks this?  AIBU?

244,"well, my parents got their dogs from several reputable breeders, none of whom kicked up a fuss about 2-3 days a week of the dogs being left at home. Yes, it's not the optimal situation, but it's not the end of the world for the dogs to be unstimulated (?!) for a few hours - I would be uncomfortable leaving a single dog alone, but 2 or 3 dogs together act like a pack - ours have the run of the house, and only chew their own toys. they are not particularly well trained, but were disciplined (i.e. told 'No!') when they were littler, and so are fine now. People always comment on how lovely the dogs are, even the vets, whereas several family friends who never leave the dog for more than an hour at a time, make sure dog is always being stimulated and always give the dog attention have ended up with neurotic hounds who howl whenever they want attention. (btw, I know my parent's dogs do not do this, as on occasion when I was at home studying, they were left downstairs for up to 8 hours at a time alone, and there were NO problems.)

Basically Paolosgirl, it's up to you and your family what you'd be comfortable with.

I will continue to be boggled by the apparent expectation from trans allies that the best way to deal with trans children who we are told are uniquely vulnerable to suicide and self harm is to encourage teachers with no specialist knowledge to affirm them in their self diagnosis with no further input.

You can’t play that both ways, as was said upthread.

380,"Hi all I am really struggling at the moment so can anyone offer me the wisdom of experience or some comfort?

I have posted on here previously about the demise of my 11 year marriage due to my STBXH online activities/sexting/hookups etc.
So to summarise after discovering for the first time in 2014 I had given it three more chances. After a fresh start house move and my becoming ill he continued to do his online stuff so 5 weeks ago I left and filed for divorce. The house sold in a week and I left the family home, sold all my stuff and made a new start in a rented flat.
Everything has been going really well and I have been on MN a lot but have been truly saddened at the amount of posts similar to my own, which has awoken my own situation very much.
I consider myself lucky that my son is 20 (so many people on here with young children) so I can have life very much on my terms.
I have joined a gym seen friends and had a lot of fun, as I realise now that I have not really been in love with STBXH for about a year, but really needed to leave when I was ready.
I had a couple of bad days sorting out practicalities did a bit of grieving and felt happier and healthier than I have in years, knowing in my heart that it was really for the best....
So I have met a guy for lunch. I have known him for a couple of years and we have kept in touch throughout. There is a connection there so we met up and talked and laughed for over 7 hours. We flirted and then he told me that he dont like games he is very attracted to me and cant understand why my STBXH would risk losing me. He said that he understands I am vulnerable and will not pressure me and just treasures my time and the fact I make him laugh and he feels comfortable and feels so happy when he is with me.
Now - this is bringing up al kinds of feelings for me. As in why could I have not met him in six months time?? As an ordinary 46 year old woman I appreciate that the dating pool is limited and I see this an an opportunity (not a relationship as I clearly not ready) but it seems unfair. He makes me feel great ge texts when he says he will, he is NORMAL and is sincere not all predatory or just after a quick one.
This is all very confusing for me and I have been weeping today as why could not my STBXH have treated me like that, actually just with kindness and be attracted to me?? 
I feel guilty in a way and the new guy is just so nice. I am not used to nice or to be listened to or to be made to feel attractive etc..
I have been thinking of all the nice stuff right at the beginning of my marriage. Like when I nearly died and was in hospital for weeks. STBXH walked for miles in the snow to visit me everyday and other memories which are so painful now I can barely recall.
Is this the last of the grieving process? I am asking for advice as my BF is abroad, my other friends are ill/ busy and my Mum is just relieved I finally walked away from the whole mess. I told her about new flirtation and she just said have fun and dont over think t happy that I seem to have finally moved on and will not be returning to the dysfunctional marriage that dragged on for too many years.

442,"while I personally wouldn't breed from any animal of mine, I do think it is incredibly arrogant  to assume that A, only a (reputable, which appear to be in the minority) breeder and (reputable, which appear to be in the minority) rescue can possibly know how to rehome a dog responsibly, and B, that anyone who gets a dog from anywhere other than A is a bad dog owner who will end up dumping it.  

Would I buy a puppy from the services on the m4 - not a chance.  But would I take one from a neighbour whose dog had had puppies, knowing that her dogs are well loved, well cared for, that although their existance was an unfortunate series of events where perhaps a female had got out while in season (for instance), that she was going to find good, loveing homes for them and get the bitch spayed asap? yes probably.  And in truth, even the person who takes the puppy from the breeder who is prepared to deliver it to them on the Bristol junction isn't necessarily a bad owner.  Perhaps a little misguided because giving money to these people does fuel the supply of such puppies, but often people who buy them have the right intentions - to give them good, loving homes.  You don't need a rescue or a breeder to tell you whether or not you can be a good owner.  And ultimately, these puppies have to go somewhere.  I wouldn't want one because I wouldn't want to give money to someone who overbreeds their dogs and thus encourage them to continue doing so.  But if I then walk away from a litter of eight week old puppies, what do you think happens to them?  Even if you report the breeder to the RSPCA there are no guarantees.  They don't simply walk in and shut down these breeders - it just doesn't happen like that.  So the puppies, who are already in existance, end up with an even more miserable life.  Which is why so many people do actually decide to bite the bullet and take them on regardless of the risks.  It's simply not as black and white as people on here like to make out.

And just because someone answers the questions a breeder asks doesn't make them any less likely to end up dumping the dog on the motorway when the going gets tough, or leave it shut up all day every day while they go out to work having told the breeder they intend to hire a dog walker/be at home for the majority of the time.  Once a breeder (or rescue for that matter) hands over a puppy you have no idea where it could end up.

And who decides what is and what isn't a reputable breeder and what makes for good and bad trates?  

Incidentally, the labradoodle came into existence because they were considered a good match as guide dogs for those owners who have allergies.  The result was a bit of a disaster, as they were crap as guide dogs, and after that they were presumably rehomed and became a bit of a designer dog.  No-one faulted their being bred for guide dogs, yet somehow it's wrong to have one as a pet?  Similarly with cockerpoo's - hearing dogs breed them and that's ok because ... for whatever reason they make good hearing dogs, but want one as a pet and that is somehow wrong?  Surely it's either wrong, or it isn't.  

And for those saying that it's wrong to breed cockerpoo's/labradoodles etc - why?  Someone is going to breed them.  whether people like it or not there is a market for these dogs.  Surely it is better that there be people out there who genuinely care about these animals who will breed them responsibly?  

Guide dogs breed their own dogs for inteligence/trainability/suitability as guide dogs.  The pass rate for guide dogs bred puppies vs donated puppies is considerably higher - about 90% vs about 50%  iirc.  Yet it's got to a point now where more and more guide dogs are being withdrawn earlier due to behavioral problems, and a vast amount of the argument behind that is inbreeding - the lines have become so inbred now that there are more and more problems.  There are very few of the health problems, but there are a lot more of the behavioral problems.  One of the most common guide dogs is the lab retriever cross.  Yet of all the dogs I know who have been retired early  due to behavior, they have all been crosses.  They tend to be either incredibly stubbern or highly strung.  And yet there aren't any calls for guide dogs to stop breeding their own puppies because of what they're doing to the lines, why is this?  Because they're working dogs and that somehow makes it ok?

*@LittleBearPad* I did ask earlier if your workplace altered working practices due to Covid?

I am just reading the DfE contingency plans
^Unless advised otherwise, all settings should continue to operate *as normal* irrespective of local restriction tier, and all children and pupils should continue to attend unless they are required to self-isolate.^

If they are facing staff shortages or capacity issues, the DfE recommend:
^using staff, such as trainees more flexibly^
^supply staff^
^recruiting both permanent and short-term staff via the Teaching Vacancies Service^
so extra staff CAN be used as a reaction to crisis but the DfE haven't extended schools budgets to use extra staff to allow bubbles to be smaller.
Maybe a slice of the estimated £220million that went into estabishing the Nightingale Hospitals could have gone to schools budgets for combatting Covid community spread instead?

You say what can they implement by Monday - they could offer tests to staff before they go back in for one thing!

485,"My understanding on soy ( your post is interesting!) is that the jury is still out on it. 

In men, too much soy can promote breast development or have feminising effects ( the men in my family used to use soy due to dairy intolerance but stopped after these reports.)

In women there is a suspicion that for women who have had breast cancer, soy could promote growth again.

Personally I feel the whole issue is very complex; the recent book on estrogen and BC 'Estrogen Matters' (Dr Avrum Blooming- who is speaking on the video I linked to, down this forum) says his research shows estrogen does not cause BC and may even reduce the risks (and indeed my menopause consultant says the same.)

One factor is def obesity in the west - compared to japan.

In Japan, weigh-ins happen in the work place and employers can face financial penalties for being overweight. There are cultural pressures on staying slim and there is no 'fat shaming' - or rather there is, but in a positive way to make sure people don't become obese.

In the video I linked to, it shows that in the normal female population, 23:1000 women will get BC. This more than doubles - another 25:1000 - if women are overweight (BMI 25+.)

Yet for women on some types of HRT there are only 4 more cases. 

And for women on estrogen-only HRT there are 4 FEWER cases, compared with the baseline population (women not on any HRT.)

So, maybe soy does some good, but maybe the dominant factor comparing Japan and the West, is weight and drinking; some Asians are not on the whole able to metabolise alcohol (genetically) so they drink far less.",2018-11-29 08:01:32+00:00,3435491,Women who have been through meno without HRT,menopause

My dd can throw the best tantrums, I just leave her where she throws herself and let her get it out of her system for a bit. Stuff what anyone else thinks around you it's your child and none of their business as long as your ds is safe. 
 
There are various tactics for dealing with tantrums: 
Have a think about what sets him off. A lot of children get ratty when tired or hungry so maybe avoid going out when it's close to sleep or meal times, or take snacks and drink with you. 
If you can see one starting to brew you could try creating a diversion (eg. I just saw a monkey over there, can you see it), but this takes a lot of imagination and effort on your part which is not always possible with another baby in tow. 
 
I would say don't back down and start giving in to his demands, this is a time in his development when he's testing limits and if he knows he'll get what he wants with a tantrum then it won't give him an incentive to stop. Just keep telling him you love him when he's screaming (you'll probably need to remind yourself that you do!) but explain firmly why he can't have his own way. 
 
Having said that, if it's really not a battle that you need to fight then relax and go with what will ease the situation. 
 
Don't be frightened of tantrums, they are a necessary part of growing up and won't do him any harm at all. Being 2 is a very confusing time. Just keep him safe and loved and it will pass - and remember, don't give a stuff about what other people think.",2007-02-22 20:34:51+00:00,282664,Can&#39;t cope with the tantrums!!,parenting

I also hated meeting up with people with colds etc. My eldest caught a fair few stomach bugs in her first few years and I am very cautious with those sorts of things too. One of my friends the week before Christmas sent her child back to school on the Tuesday morning. He had started with a vomiting bug Sunday night. Monday morning he had a bad stomach. I kept my child off school for the last day of term. They are best friends and I just couldn't bare risking christmas being ruined. 

Absolutely no way should she be expecting to come near them with a bad chest. 

One thing I will say is I've had to come to terms with all this in the last 5 months. My daughter is now at school and currently has a horrible cough. A cough I would like to keep her home for. But I can't because she's already had six days off since September. Not many for a four year old but we've had an attendance warning from the school that it's below 95%. So I've sent her in with it. Half her class has it too. Her best mate is barking with it and streaming nose. He holds onto my pushchair on the way home and coughs all over my toddler. I can't say much about it so I just have to let it go. Germs are now unavoidable now she's at school. I still hate it deep down but I have to just accept it and pray with time she gets stronger. I feel sorry for the youngest as he's taken a bashing from all the viruses that come home. 

People could help to stop spreading things so easy. But people send children to school and nursery ill (I even do it abit now with colds and coughs) although on bad days i have kept her home. It's something that will continue to be an issue for you I suspect. It definitely frustrates me. I hate seeing them run down. Her pre school year was grim. Her nursery was an absolute germ breeding ground. I eventually counted and she had 17 illnesses in 11 months. Awful year!

Out of all of the child stars I think Justin Timberlake is one of the only ones who has come out unscathed thus far, time will tell for the more recent ones.

To me all of this is the natural rebellion that should have happened in her teens and should now be tailing  off at 21. But her teens were basically taken out of her hands. She had to be this wholesome girl to preserve the Disney image and obviously suppressed a lot of feelings. And so now that rebellion is happening in the full glare of the media because it's like Hannah Montana turned bad so the media are loving it.

I also run my own business (with two other partners) but I seem to be in charge of all the housekeeping elements (I'm the only woman - go figure) and it's the relentless bits and pieces of rubbish that are dismantling me slowly.  HR dramas over nothing, banking bureaucracy,  regulatory burden, niggly bits of nonsense that are really wearing me down. I have spent the past two or three years thinking ""this too will pass"" but this actually seems to be the new normal and that's an unbearable prospect.   I think we have to be wary of thinking ""this too will pass"" or we risk spending our lives just getting through the drudgery in the hope that things will get better one day.  

One thing I have done and one thing I am thinking of doing:

a) I've basically ditched cooking other than as an occasional leisure activity.  It's become a huge part of the drudgery burden and the pressure I was putting on myself to make sure the children eat something cooked from scratch every night was just an unnecessary burden.  I know it's heresy on MN but basically they get a good lunch at school so if we have lots of soup and beans on toast / egg on toast / hummous and carrots for dinner then I'm saying that's fine.   It's going to have to be anyway.  Then I'll make more of an effort when I have time and space and I feel like it.  At the weekend we might all cook together and it'll be for fun but cooking up a whole meal on a Tuesday night after a full day of work and homework wrangling and household admin is finished?  Not fun

b. Although my children are still at full time school and I'd gone down to part time after school care, it's not working.  I've had 7 people in the role since last Feb.  Awful.  Totally disruptive and unsustainable.  This despite the fact that I pay really well and make few demands.  Part of it is that it's hard to find people round here who want after school work - so I'm thinking of a year of a full time nanny again.  Ridiculous expense but I can't go through another year like this.  And as I said earlier, the holidays are killing me.  Just the mental load of where the kids need to be and what time and with what kit.  Obviously this is not an option for lots of people but I'm thinking it's this or a breakdown so in that context, it's worth exploring.  

I actually just want to slow down and enjoy my life more.

569,"...avoiding (evading?) stamp duty?

My lovely ex-neighbours sold their house 4 years ago to the --Morons-- current people.  The bloke steamrollered old neighbours into accepting £10,000 of the sale price in cash so that they could avoid paying the higher band of stamp duty.  Sale price was £510,000.  £500,000 went through the usual channels and the £10,000 they gave directly to sellers in cash.

At the time the housing market was teetering on brink of crash and sellers were anxious to get it sold.

None of my business really.

But...my new neighbours of 4 years are bullying arseholes.  They've complained about the noise of us walking about our house (we're semi-detached).  That we get up earlier than them (7am to their 7.30) and go to bed later (11pm ish and later at weekends...no idea what their bedtimes are).  If we're walking about upstairs they hammer on the walls.  The woman accosted me in the street, while I was carrying my baby from the car into the house, and told me she was going to get me Asbo'd (presumably for walking about my house we don't often do late night parties etc. Even if we have people round we're in the extension which is furthest away from the bedrooms).  We have never had any ""official"" complaints, however.  When they get drunk they hammer on the walls or throw things at the party wall.  They complain and have shouted at us for parking in front of their house.  It is a public highway with no driveways, anyone can park anywhere in the street.  He once drove down the wrong side of the road in a game of chicken when he spotted me driving up...swerving at the last moment.  I had the DCs in the car at the time.  He also stops and stares at my two little girls when they're coming and going from the house.  He's trying to intimidate us, he doesn't give us a second look when my DH is around, however.  They're a couple in their late thirties, early forties with 2 young DCs themselves.  They are both professionals.  Their madness stems from the perceived noise nuisance.  However, ex-neighbours say the new folk are being totally ridiculous and they found noise levels from us to be normal...they even sent us flowers and champagne when they left and a note thanking us for being great neighbours.

After 4 years, I'm pretty sick of them.  Our home is perfect for us other than these twats next door.

There's not much we can do, but I really feel like dropping them in it with the tax thing, though I've no idea if after 4 years it would even be looked into or how to go about reporting it.  Or maybe just having a word with myself to mind my own beeswax.

[quote Loola81]This is not ok. This is sexism. Boys don’t grow out of sexism and we cannot excuse this because of age or occurrence. She should not feel shit because of her biology as a girl- end of. I’m a teacher. This kind of behaviour doesn’t magically go away or improve. In fact, sexism has become rampant and viscous. She deserves an education free of sex discrimination and abuse. Ask your daughter to jot down everything she can remember that is sexist behaviour: unsolicited touching, bra snapping, upskirting, boys going into girls toilets, cat-calling, boys monopolising space and resources, intimidation, pressure to send nudes etc. Present this to the Principal and demand that sexism is addressed across the entire school. Sexism is not a joke or just boys being boys; it is a breach of human rights and I’m sick of so many girls being subject to this abuse and it’s relentless. I’m appalled so many commentators think this is no big deal- that just proves what a problem we have- adults don’t even consider sexism an issue. Fight this. Your daughter needs to see you act so she never thinks this is acceptable.[/quote]

I am glad that you are asking him to give you more space and that you are telling your parents.  I know they will view him differently should you remain together, but why should you keep his secrets for him?  Who is that helping but him?

Agree with YetMoreCrap that if you don't ask for space, after a few weeks he will just presume you should have got over it - after all, he's said he's sorry, that it was just sex [hmm] .  Also, be prepared for him not being willing to stay away for more than a couple of nights.  I got my ex to leave for a couple of days when he had his first affair - but surprise surprise, he didn't like it and came back. (I had just changed the fucking sheets too and he was ""so tired he went to bed for the afternoon"" in my clean bed - not helping with kids so absolutely no fucking use at all.)  I suggested he stay with his parents - flat refusal.  I didn't know what to do - could hardly physically throw him out could I?  It was his house too, so I let myself be talked round to giving him a second chance only for him to walk out 8 years later when it suited him better.  I wish now I had reluctantly allowed him back but made it clear that I really wanted a divorce - and then told my parents and friends.

Sorry for the ramble (can you tell I am still angry more than 20 years later?) but my point is - be very clear that you are making no firm decisions yet and even if he comes back he cannot presume anything.

613,"posted this and went straight to bed last night. Some really interesting arguments....my objection to prostitution (however the prostitute came to be in his/her line of work, be it through desperation or selection) is that it relies on the custom of those who are able to impose themselves physically upon another human being, all the while ^knowing^ its not consensual - in the sense that one of the partners is not participating with lust or love. It's an intrinsic physical abuse of another body in my view and I believe there are serious moral and emotional deficiencies in someone who could divorce themselves from that awareness sufficiently for them to be able to do what they do.

That is of course a total indictment on a larger scale of how some of us relate to other human beings in contemporary society - I realise prostitution is an age old tradition and refer specifically to contemporary society because we are hypocritical and insidious enough to drape a thin veil of equality and political correct exteriors over everything as though we are somehow more developed or aware, which makes it worse imo.

The posters who have said this would have been a different story had the highest bidder been a one eyed, smelly, abusive man are right - the girl (and she is a girl) would have been traumatised. Maybe she still will be, who knows.

On the other hand, the girl seems extremely philosophical about this so perhaps it's something she will not look back on and regret. She got what she wanted from the exercise after all.

 She makes out that she was worn down by the care because Imogen screamed for the entire first year. But she only had her for 5 months. She did 'lots' of research before deciding to leave her in hospital. Yes a whole week's worth. She did it to save the relationship with her elder child - you can do that without abandoning a disabled child. Beardy is 'a loving father' whilst he was dumping Immie's stuff presumably. She would never be capable of forming relationships- except she has one with Tania (which she seems to need the professionals to confirm as a 'real' relationship). She kept on going on about a 'normal relationship', What does she think a normal mother-child relationship is? It's about touch and love and that deep bond not playing. 

I don't understand why she's done the book. I can understand (especially after reading time4me's post) about the shock of being told your child is severely disabled (and to a certain extent we didn't get that because ds1 was assumed to be far less affected than he is- I never initially considered that he would need lifelong 24 hour care for example) but to then create this weird version of reality - which doesn't make sense then publically hold it up. That weird comment about 'symbolically' still being her parent. WTF? 

She doesn't sound to me as if she's gone through some great journey as she talks about it as if it happened to someone else. Nothing of what she says makes any sense to me.",2008-03-04 20:46:38+00:00,488946,Mail on Sunday Magazine,special_needs

I'm getting really tight uncomfortable bump in the evenings too - I don't know if it is BH as it lasts for bloody ages. It still seems like the baby is really high up in there. Hopefully I'll get some good news on NYE when I see the midwife and she might be head down - although i'm doubtful, she seems pretty comfy in there. I'm 35+1 so getting a bit concerned but hopefull she'll get shifting soon.

I'm sooo glad to be home and get to sleep in my own bed tonight! It's been lovely to see the family but bed at PIL was like rock so every 45mins I was awake with sore legs and hips and having a mammoth turn over. Last night was in my niece's really awful single bed (which was at least softer, if rather springy) - and horror of horrors - a downstairs loo at the back of the house! Luckily I only needed about 5 wees in the night so it wasn't too traumatic trekking to it. 

I'm planning a similar NYE to most of you - having a quiet night in with DH. He's hopefully off work for the next 3 days so we're planning on just having a lovely lazy rest after a busy Christmas week. Then it's time for operation prepare for baby! I feel the need to make lists and get major batch cooking done! I've bought my birthing pool on ebay finally - so baby HAS to get right way round now so I can have my home birth! Still quite a few bits to get and sort though, plus nursery to sort out and paint. 

Eeeek it's so exciting that we're all so nearly there. I do get a bit freaked out every now and then when I realise i'm going to have an actual baby but on the whole I'm just so excited to meet her!

[quote Helleofabore]This has been an interesting thread.

It seems that so many people have the belief that women = adult human female. And for the most part recognize that there are conflicting issues between the rights that activists (not necessarily trans people) want and those for supporting, protecting and providing opportunities for women and girls. 

The difference does seem to be the extent of who can be considered a woman for those areas where some feel lower boundaries are ok.  Toilets and changing rooms seem to have been yet again brought up. 

For those who believe that ‘passing’ transwomen are ok to use women’s toilets, the whole issue is - who arbitrates who passes and who doesn’t? What about women who need toilets to NOT be open to any males? And do you advocate for an alternative solution rather than throwing women who have need of a strict single sex space out of their needed space?

What do you propose as a solution because by the sounds of it, many of you have thought enough about it?[/quote]
""Toilets and changing rooms seem to have been yet again brought up."" because it's about women and girls having safe spaces. If you saw a girl going into a women's toilet and a few minutes later an adult man walked in what would you do? 

At any other time in history, the sensible response would be to check the girl was safe. Why is that?",2021-03-28 19:26:43+00:00,4204540,Are there any none-gender critical people on this board? ,womens_rights

I was absolutely unable to cope with the situation and even on the day I was given my results I had my fingers in my ears so as not to hear them.

You do sound very angry OP, and you do have a lot going on. But, very kindly, so do a lot of people at the moment. 

I don’t know what work you do, but often stuff that is ‘essential’ actually isn’t - talk to your managers about this. Originally you said 10 -12 hour days. 10 is ok (normal ish). 12 every day is a lot (are you working weekends too?) Your example of recording lots of data on hours etc seems like it could be streamlined and produce the same results for instance.

761,"If you have young DC, you will have better luck finding a rescue dog through the breed-specific rescues that foster the dogs in people's homes.

As for finding a breeder, you will get conflicting advice about what is good and what is bad. The first thing you need to do is decide what t you want to do with a dog (long or short walks, agility etc), and then think about breeds that fit that (along whatever aesthetic or practical considerations you have too - short fur, not too big, whatever).

Then consider health and what health tests are advised for the breed, and how important you think these are (for example, hip testing is still recommended in some breeds that have, on the whole, decent hip scores). I'd always want tests done on at least one parent for simple recessives that are common in a breed like PRA in spaniels. I would be less worried about testing for rare diseases.

Some people will say that you must go to the breed club to find a breeder but if you want puppies with at least one health-tested parent you can start to track down breeders and litters on ChampDogs. I have seen some really excellent puppies advertised there.

I would ask a breeder how many dogs they have (I'd cross off anyone with more than about 8 or 10, unless I was after e.g. a racing sled dog), how often they breed and why they breed. Some people will just be breeding their family pet because they had Great-Gran and have Gran and Mum and want another generation. If you want a pet, the puppies come from adequately health-tested stock (for example, the sire is known to be clear of any recessive nasties), the breeder has made sure that the sire and dam aren't too closely related, and the breeder will take good and competent care of bitch and pups, there is in my view nothing wrong with this arrangement. Or you can go to someone who breeds for the show ring or for work, and has a couple of litters a year - also good, provided they also tick the boxes regarding health, not inbreeding and giving the bitch and pups really good care.

Personally I do not care if a breeder is council licensed or not, but in my view you must ALWAYS see the puppies with their dam (if she had died I would want to see proof from a vet) and you must ALWAYS see them where they are being brought up: I would want to see a puppy with mum at least once before I collected it to take home. I would never buy a puppy from any sort of commercial facility (the sort where there is at leat one litter on the ground almost all the time, there are several dozen bitches, and bitches who have had 4 or 5 litters are sold off to 'loving 5* homes for their well-deserved retirements!') These outfits tend to produce a lot of popular crosses - decent breeders of said popular crosses do exist but are thin on the ground.",2020-10-10 21:04:53+00:00,4047334,Where do we start?,the_doghouse

773,""" They've said that when they issue a warranty, if the building control checks aren't done by them then they instead issue the warranty based purely on their own guidelines.""

It is incredibly rare (read: unprecedented, in my 35 years in the industry) to find a warranty by the NHBC where they didn't also undertake the building control. It just wouldn't make any sense. The exception is in Scotland and Northern Ireland, where different systems apply and the NHBC are not ^allowed^ to take on the Building Control  function.

There is a single application form (known as a SNIN - Site Notification and Initial Notice) to the NHBC that covers both building control and warranty registration. The 'site notification' is the NHBC warranty part and the 'initial notice' is  the formal notice that the NHBC is instructed to tell the Local Authority that they, not the Local Authority, will be handling the building control... the whole NHBC system is therefore joined at the hip, so to speak.

It ^does^ have a separate tick-box to say whether you want them to undertake building control or not, but I've never known anyone who would use them for warranty but not BC, and once you've filled in that form, the rest of the process is entirely seamless between the two sides, so far as the developer/builder is concerned.

I don't know how far you'd get, but you might try asking the NHBC to provide a copy of the SNIN for the site, which might give additional clues.

If you are 100% certain that neither the NHBC nor the Local Authority handled the building control, then unless you can establish who _did_ deal with it, don't walk away - ^run^.",2018-02-23 11:18:54+00:00,3175302,No certificate of completion on 10 year old flat,property

It lets them actually campaign to remove safeguards.

846,"*All involve using women. Just to varied degrees. Its the nudge nudge nudge of the line of acceptability to use women . All of this makes women nothing more than passive recipients of whatever men decide they should be used for.*

Every single word of this.

This is what I can’t get my head around.

ALL of transgenderism (or whatever you want to call it) is based on this. Male people ^using^ female people. Members of the oppressor class ^using^ members of the class their class has traditionally oppressed.

Appropriation of us and our spaces. Colonisation. Straight up oppression of female human beings by male human beings. The centring of the male humans’ needs/wishes/feelings at the expense of the female humans’.

Our humanity is being denied. We are, yet again, merely adjuncts to the lives of the “real” humans, the male ones.

I can’t get my head around why this isn’t blindingly obvious to more people. Why *@MNHQ* talk about how they will ”stand in solidarity with vulnerable or oppressed minorities” and just don’t get that it’s the *majority* who’s actually vulnerable and oppressed here, the 51%. 

We must all know that being more numerous does not always equate to being more powerful; surely people haven’t forgotten the reality of life for Black people under apartheid in SA already?

We must all know that the power that women as a class wield in society still falls very, very far short of that wielded by men as a class. In ALL societies, worldwide. This should not be something that needs to be proved over and over again, to be backed up by endless studies and statistics (although the studies and statistics exist and do, obviously, prove it).

I wish MNHQ would stand in solidarity with vulnerable and oppressed WOMEN, many of whom turn to MN as a source of much-needed support. 

I wish *@JustineMN* realised that although perhaps her life has been easier than that of some male individuals with gender dysphoria, the same is not true of many, many of us on here whose lives have been disproportionately full of pain and struggle, who have survived (sometimes barely) abuses of all kinds, who have battled and continue to battle umpteen issues of all kinds, many of which proceed directly from the fact of having been born female; all of which are compounded and further impacted by the fact of our having been born female.

WE are the ones being fucked over here. We are the ones most affected by all this, we are the ones who most struggle to make our voices heard, the ones least likely to be able to speak for ourselves, the ones who are being and will be *hurt* by this phenomenon of transgenderism, this new form of male oppression. This new and oh so modern variation of men *using* women as extensions of their own lives, refusing to see and treat us as human beings in our own right.

This is misogyny, this blind, unconscious acceptance that men are more human than women, that they matter more, that what affects them should be taken more seriously than what affects women. I’ve grown up with it, lived with it all my life; no longer on a day to day, personal level thankfully, but it’s still part of the world I live in, the air I breathe, that we all breathe.

I struggle to post on here. I would love to be a more regular part of the conversation, but it takes too much out of me to post. I still don’t have the voice I would love to have. Other women don’t have any voice at all. We are silenced on Twitter, on FB, on here if we don’t watch ourselves very, very carefully. Many of us have not grown up being told we are allowed to speak, entitled to be heard; women as a class are still fighting for the right to be heard.

Whereas TRAs have any number of platforms and organisations advocating for them, funding them, fighting for their right to oppress women every bit as much as they want. They have the advantage and privilege of male entitlement, the belief they have the right to their voice, and doesn’t it just show.

It’s upside down and batshit to present women as privileged relative to a subset of the male sex class that is *actually* the more privileged of the two sexes and always has been. Just because there are way more women than males who want to be seen as women doesn’t mean we are more powerful; I think the events of the last couple of decades and especially the last few years have proved that. We are the objects being used by the subjects; they are the ones oppressing us, we are the ones who are vulnerable.

And now they get to demonise us for not wanting to be mere accessories in their lives.

877,"*Many women have children in their 40s* I really strongly feel this is a dangerous message that required context. 

It is MUCH harder to get pregnant after 35 let alone 40. 

And even if you do get pregnant you're at a considerably higher risk for mc, premature and stillbirth, pregnancy complications that put the mothers life and future health at serious risk, the child having an illness/disability - which as a pp pointed out may already be a risk for op. 

There's also the fact, as I'm sure as someone who works in childcare op already knows, caring for babies and young children is KNACKERING! 

I'm an ex childminder and nanny myself and had dd when I was 28 and I definitely needed the energy I had back then. 

The thought of doing broken nights, running around after a toddler, teething, weaning etc in my 40's is exhausting just to think about!! 

Out of my friends and family the ones who waited to have dc in their late 30's and 40's while they didn't regret having their children the vast majority wished they'd done it when they were younger. 

While societally/culturally it may be more popular the biology has not changed that much from my generation and older evolution takes more than a few decades. 

And freezing eggs is by no means a guarantee either, conceiving naturally is generally more likely. 

*I know too many couples who have waited and waited to start a family - generally at the mans behest - only to find that when they do start trying they have problems and don’t qualify for NHS Ivf as too old. Ivf is also much less likely to succeed/you are much more likely to miscarry as you get older.* I have this experience also, I know one mother and daughter the mother had said to the daughter to ttc sooner rather than later as gynae issues in family, daughter ignored and had great difficulty conceiving, had several mc and eventually had her son at 43. Unable to have any more which she wanted to. 

*you still have easy 10 years of child bearing to go, unless their is a history of early menopause in your family?* 

There speaks someone with VERY little knowledge or experience with regard to conception and pregnancy & birth. 

Early menopause is but ONE factor. There are literally thousands of others.

900,"^*@maryso* ""Most jobs can be done by most people""^
^I'm guessing that you have never worked in a technical or professional field if you think that is true. The list of jobs I could never do, no matter how much training or interview coaching I got is infinite.....^

^grimupnorthLondon^, perhaps your guess is completely and utterly wrong because I failed to say ^explicitly^ that most jobs ^an English graduate like the OP's DD would look at^, can be done by most people.  She could not start medical training, work at a hedge fund, plastering, plumbing, and similar technical jobs without gaining additional specific skills. Were you thinking of these? She could certainly go for jobs such as the ones touted around MN, in law, finance, IB, FMCG-related, public sector graduate schemes. The latter category can be accessed by any bright graduate capable of making their way through the battery of cognitive tests, interviews and other games played at assessment centres, hurdles which closely resemble those that 17-year olds go through for medicine, dentistry and vet med courses that choose the person as well as the intellect. 

The hurdles set out in non-vocational jobs are more about the firm trying not to be found getting it wrong, than the applicant not being good enough. The best employers have no prejudices as to where you got your experience, only that you palpably can do the job, are generally a good egg, and unlikely to burn-out. If the job can really only be done by a certain skill set they will choose to decline (tens of) thousands of applicants no matter how lowly or highly gauged their place of learning or previous employment. The support given is immense and the very rare mistake hire will be very swiftly detected, and effective intervention taken. This is because the damage the wrong skills or attitude can do in these jobs far outweighs the cost of the vacancy. Thankfully most jobs (including ones that start trainees on 2-3 times the median UK salary) can be done by far far more people than there are jobs. Sure, you have to be someone who is able to commit and take ownership of the team outcomes. If that's the level we're talking about, then I would say that previous work experience especially of the casual sort generally done by students is a flawed, even poor,  predictor. Using that as a sieve just shows up the sort of firm you are, and will happily (for you) get you exactly the sort of worker you wish for. My personal experience (in over three decades of hiring decisions) is that I never rule anyone out, and that those with chips on their shoulders tend to rule themselves out.",2019-05-16 14:10:06+00:00,3585646,"Leaving university, without ever having had a job?",higher_education

Absolutely not offended. I just thought the odds you quoted were too big! It interested me to look at the stats. 

I think the middle are being squeezed. Some DC here do not even seem to be in the middle! More top end but possibly with the odd minute flaw.

The areas of the country where few get to Oxbridge always concerns me. I lean towards DC wanting to stay localish. Parents not working with DC to ""aim for the highest"" but are happy to aim ""good enough"" and stay where DC are happy and feel they fit in. Not scientific of course but it is difficult to imagine some very large areas have no bright DC at all who could aim for Oxbridge.  

Another issue might be is that lots of MC children just are not in those areas and schools any longer. So those that are left do not aim high and the schools do not push Oxbridge.

I agree.

I’m disappointed because I don’t think the PM has done enough to avoid us going into a much more restrictive lockdown in a few weeks from now, which I want to avoid at all costs.

I am so worried about the costs of a lockdown to many vulnerable families.
I was not ^hoping^ for anything because I don’t want this to be happening to us.

I was ^expecting^ more.

Such as :
restriction in mixing of more than one household (with the exception of necessary childcare including grandparents)

Wearing of masks in public (even outside)

For 2 weeks.

I don't think weddings down from 30 to 15 and pubs closing at 10pm is going to cut it.

No , I don’t know the future, but that’s what I think.[/quote]

To maintain anonymity I’ve changed name and not disclosing my relationship to “Anne” here. But it’s immediate family. 

Anne and Mike are together for 5 years. During this time he cheats, and Anne takes him back. Anne’s best friend Karen is such a good friend, a shoulder to cry on. Karen also lives 2 doors down.  Anne Karen and Mike spend several evenings a week together, along with other friends, socialising and having a drink. Karen and Anne do lots together, as best friends do. Holidays, exercise classes, daily morning coffees, after work drinks. Years pass and Mike cheats again. He’s been acting differently and Anne can tell somethings up. Again, Karen is a shoulder to cry on, helps Anne pack his bags and throw him out. 

Turns out Karen and Mike have been getting together and Anne has been none the wiser. They deny it for months even though there are several clues hinting at their relationship. They both say it was a one time thing but eventually are found out to be living together. 

Remember this is in plain sight of Anne’s house and now she is having to watch them live a life out together. Neither have apologised or shown any kind of remorse for literally ruining Anne’s life, making her feel such torment.

[quote InvisibleDragon]For people saying that this kind of writing is over your heads, I just want to highlight this comment by Richard Feynman, who won the Nobel prize in physics:

^There was this sociologist who had written a paper for us all to read ahead of time. I started to read the damn thing, and my eyes were coming out: I couldn’t make head nor tail of it! I figured it was because I hadn’t read any of the books on the list. I had this uneasy feeling of “I’m not adequate,” until finally I said to myself “I’m gonna stop, and read one sentence slowly so I can figure out what the hell it means.”^

^So I stopped-at random-and read the next sentence very carefully. I can’t remember it precisely, but it was very close to this: “The individual member of the social community often receives his information via visual, symbolic channels.” I went back and forth over it, and translated. You know what it means? “People read.”^

^Then I went over the next sentence, and realised that I could translate that one also. Then it became a kind of empty business: “Sometimes people read; sometimes people listen to the radio,” and so on, but written in such a fancy way that I couldn’t understand it at first, and when I finally deciphered it, there was nothing to it.^

These excerpts are an example of that. They are written using specialist jargon and flowery, complicated language. When you translate it into plain language it says nothing.

Please don't feel intimidated by people who wrote and speak like this. It's deliberate obfuscation to hide nonsense arguments.[/quote]

1012,"You can try your hardest to make it work but it is pointless when the other person doesn't feel the same.

Letting him into your baby's life so soon was a mistake as it has made you put pressure on yourself to make it work for him and give him a father. He has a father already that is deadbeat. He doesn't need two of them.

My advice would be to have a trial separation. My hope would be you would realise what a prat you have been with and that you can manage on your own - forget about already planning your next boyfriend - and that being gorgeous to look at is worthless when they can't offer support and a mature relationship. Of course he might grow up and it all be fine or you might be so downtrodden you go back but I really hope it is the former of the three options.

Being heartbroken does hurt but you will get over it. If you stay with this idiot your life will be exhausting until he finds someone less attached, more malleable and younger. Then you will be older, more heart broken and left with an even more upset little boy.

You are doing nothing wrong at the moment unless you stay and then you are doing everything wrong. And he behaves like this because he can, because he wants to and because there are no consequences. Yet..

I fully understand about the name on the headstone being upsetting (I don't know about these things, can it be changed or would it be even more upsetting to disturb the grave?). We are thinking of a cremation and either storing or scattering the ashes somewhere special. But I can't plan the funeral until the post mortem is completed and this takes place in a different location so we're waiting for him to return. 

We hadn't really discussed names because we are from different cultures and we wanted a name that worked in both of our languages and also in English. There are a number of girls names that are common across all three languages but we hadn't found many boys names, and thought we had plenty of time to think about it. Over the last few days, although my husband and I were calling our baby by his nickname, to everyone else he is just 'the baby'. So we wanted a name so he had an identity separate from his father and I. Actually we found a name after I saw Lola's post above. I looked up names beginning with J (DH's initial) and found Jovan, which has lots of meanings, all of which feel very poignant and suit our little boy.

I would be very interested in the baby loss keepsakes, please do pass on the details. I would like something I can keep with me always. 

Are you going to mark Lucas's birthday? Jovan was born only a few days after my birthday and as it was a 'big' one this year, I had a celebration with friends and family.

1035,"I have been the OW twice when I was very much younger (and more foolish)

Once with someone who's marriage was already in the throes of breaking up and I suspected that his wife was already havig an affair (subsequently proved right). I loved him and thought there was a good chance that he would stay with me. I gave him an ultimatum in the end - me or your marriage - they decided to try again and I was devastated, however I respected them both for trying to salvage their marriage. They were both at fault for letting their marriage to deteriorate to that point and I hardly helped. I wish I had been strong enough to give him the choice *before* starting the affair, it would have been better for us all.

The second was a short fling with someone much older in work and was really on the rebound. I didn't know his wife and it was easy for me to pretend that it wasn't my issue, that it wasn't me that was married and that he had to take his own responsibility for being faithful or not.

In truth very few affairs don't hurt *somebody* and should therefore be avoided if possible in my very humble opinion.

We referred to ourselves as his new mummy, daddy and sister and also by our names. He chose to use mummy and daddy and sister straight away.

It's also good for him. If he had started school calling us by our names it would have probably led to him being known to be adopted straight away. We wanted that to be private.

He said he just liked the attention she gave him as she used to flirt with him at work and it made him feel good. He didn't like it when she stopped liking his stuff on facebook. But he maintains he has no interest in her and would have asked her out if he did.

Our school are giving 20% discount next term. They have furloughed non teaching staff. They are still open for families with parents in the nhs (we live near a big hospital).

Before Easter the remote teaching offered was pretty poor but it was only for a week and they had a lot to organise in a short timeframe. We were all getting used to wfh too, it was a strange time. 
But some of the other parents are furious. They want it all - a huge reduction in fees plus a comprehensive online learning service. They have been sending harsh emails to the head making all sorts of demands and asking other parents to sign. I feel sorry for the staff, they are doing their best and have the threat of losing their job too.
It is hard balancing working and home schooling but I don't think taking it out on the school is the answer.
We have received details of teaching for after Easter - recorded lessons so we can do them when it suits us rather than at certain times, online marking of work, 1:1 online meetings with each staff member each week to discuss any issues, they are setting enough work for 6hrs a day for my yr5 child and also a whole area for exam prep (11+ is in September). They are also organising group Zoom meetings and encouraging social interaction between the children.
 I think this is enough and will work well (maybe not for my reception age child!).
I see our school as a community rather than just a service. I don't want them to go out of business or have to suffer because of this, my youngest has another 6 years there.
I can understand that parents are under financial pressure (and we are fortunate that we are not at the moment) but if you are worried about one term's fees is private school right for you?

1125,"Hi all, I've read so many mumsnet conversations over the years and never posted anything until now. I'm married, aged 35, with a 7 year old child and after a number of unsuccessful rounds of ICSI, I think my consultant will suggest going to donor eggs/embryos next. 
Really don't know what to do, my partner and I could get over the lack of genetic connection but I'm not sure I can face more cycles. Also, we're Asian so that adds another complication trying to find Asian donors. 
I don't think either of us are up for adoption, we're scared that an adopted child would be too much to take on for us and detrimental to our birth DD. However, we always imagined our life with 2 children.

This is my history:
2013 - Had ICSI due to mild MFI (low motility), resulted in DD born 2014
2017 - FET, had a miscarriage at 6 wks
2019 - Stage 3 Endometriosis discovered, had laparascopy to remove.
2019 - ICSI, 5 eggs collected, 1 average 3DT transferred, nothing to freeze, had BFP but miscarriage soon after.
2020 - ICSI, 8 eggs collected but sperm was terrible in that cycle, nothing to freeze, 2 average embryos, had 3DT, BFN
2021 - ICSI, switched clinics, 14 eggs collected of which 13 mature, 5 fertilised, 1 embryo, 5DT, BFN. Nothing to freeze. Had intralipids with that cycle as Level 1 and 2 tests confirmed high NK cells.

SGB is quite correct.  This man doesn't ""forget"" as you suggest. He knows very well that you don't want to be groped but carries on regardless.  He has no thought for your feelings on the subject.  You are his wife and therefore his possession to do with what he will.  I would also be very wary as SGB and Diggs have suggested, of this escalating.

1133,"Would all TM regardless of stage of transition wish to be placed on a male ward and feel safe there? In all circumstances? 

I can't think many reasonable female people would feel that any TM who when injured, ill, vulnerable and possibly needing invasive or intimate care with nothing more than a flimsy curtain between them and the male occupants of the ward, or in the face of the reality of the specific male patients currently there on the ward, should ever have to be put in that position if they did not want it. Because their dignity, privacy, sense of safety and actual safety and their ability to be relaxed and to rest and to be able to recover all matter a great deal, and being on a male ward may very well to a TM not always be a safe or easy or tolerable thing. 

If you see that, then you have to be able to see why it is not ok to ask all females, regardless of circumstance, to abandon their own needs in the way that you would not ask a trans person to. Equality of values. 

In the 21st century it's perfectly possible to come up with additional spaces, provisions and options that value and meet ^all^ needs instead of a binary solution in which female patients must be the losers.

1139,"At 2.5 she is probably too little to respond to being told off, which doesn't mean that you should never do it, but it won't be effective in changing her behaviour which is probably why you're getting frustrated. It may well work to show her you're unhappy with the behaviour in the moment, but the part that is not yet developed is her ability to anticipate that if she does whatever it is again she will get told off again, AND for that to actually help her control her impulses and make a different decision. Those are more complicated skills which she will develop more later.

So you need to do other things alongside which will actually be effective to change patterns. Ideally before the behaviour, rather than in response to it.

Does she go to nursery at all/is she due to start soonish?

How much opportunity is she getting to run off excess energy and be physical as well? That's important at this age (a bit like dogs!) they will tend to get all that energy out in destructiveness and naughtiness otherwise. It's also a way to get attention from you, even if it's negative attention.

I only started tracking CM this cycle and I had 2-3 days EWCM around the time my FLO app predicted ovulation (but got negative OPKs) and another 2-3 days EWCM 7-10 days past my predicted ovulation date (still got neg OPKs). It's confusing definitely but I took EWCM as a green light for TTC. Surely EWCM can only be a good sign! 🙂

The doctors that suggested tracking CM were both male and far from ovulation experts. They were the best I could get at short notice in my GP. I'm seeing a woman doctor who specializes in fertility in the coming weeks (if I'm not pregnant from this cycle) so hopefully she will be able to shed more light on this. 

I was on the pill for ~7 years but I did have irregular cycles before this. I was also diagnosed with PCOS but I didn't actually have any cysts identified in the ultrasound. I just have 2/3 of the required symptoms to be diagnosed - irregular periods and hormone imbalance.

It's frustrating having longer/irregular cycles as you definitely have less chances in the year to get pregnant and it's harder to pin down ovulation but I've heard loads of very positive stories of woman getting pregnant when the odds were stacked against them. I think it's best to get as much tests done to highlight any issues as early as possible and then just try to stay positive (that's the hardest part).

- be sharing it with my line manager, because behaving like that two years after the fact (two years after ^nothing happened^ - it's not like the child was removed) is ahem unusual and I'd want my colleagues to be alert for any potentially risky visitors

1179,"I think what has bothered me is the Western-centric view of this, shown by some posters...who suggest, for example, that relactation is something majorly different, or wet nursing another woman's baby when yours has died, because here in the UK both of these options would be thought of as weird or impossible. 

Even in societies where relactation would be unusual (and I really don't know what the cultural norm is in Haiti), it would not take long to explain how to do it, and it would need hardly any supervision. This is not the case with formula - illiterate people cannot follow written instructions on a leaflet or a pack, and you just have to see the posts on here about how to cope with new guidance on making up formula to see that doing something different and new with measurements and mixing can confuse even non-traumatised, literate, educated women in the West. 

I think the branding of product is a real issue. Ethically, using a disaster as a free bit of advertising is questionable, but this matters less with food items and pharmaceuticals. Branding formula is different, because it is in commercial competition with another 'product' (breastmilk) and branding can do so much to enhance image and create an identity. So it should not be donated with any branding on it - clearly, if it is desperately needed somewhere, I would not advocate holding up its distribution because of this, but beyond this immediate response, it needs nothing more than the name of the product and a batch number so it can be identified in cases of problems. 

To my knowledge this is done in some cases, with many foods inc formula. Packages are branded with the name of the distribution agency or NGO. It's not difficult - like foxy says, it's like 'own brand' goods we get at the supermarket.",2010-01-19 09:59:06+00:00,895860,Haiti - F*****g Nestle is at it already.,breast_and_bottle_feeding

Had my first period beginning of last month. DD2 is 7mths and I breast feed her but she is also on solids and has been for awhile - guess thats why my periods came back.

Just checked the calender today was saw it was 34 since my first period. Is this normal? I dont feel like I am going to get them and I feel fine. Before my first baby my period was every 28 days and after I breastfed dd1. Could i go a couple of months without a period and could they be all irregular because I am still breastfeeding. With dd1 my period only started when I stopped.

1194,"So, camping is not, has never been and, now I can say,  will never be my thing.

People love it, I get that.  Kids and husbands I think mostly...I DONT GET IT.

We are booked to go camping with DH's cousin and his family in August.   I'm more of a city break, lovely hotel person myself but DH and DD were really keen to go --relive-- --his-- --scouting-- --days-- and not wanting to be a party pooper I decided to throw myself in there too to show willing and that basically I can do anything I put my mind to.  Turns out I'm more of a panderedto woman than superwoman!

We did a trial on the weekend in the garden with the new tent and kit DH bought.  Seriously, it was like watching him unwrap his presents on christmas morning.    His face was constantly smiling, sharing his joy with DD who loved it just as much.  I offered some help occasionally but could not get into the spirit of it at all.  He even put up little fairy lights around the rope thingies to add a little bit of glam for me  [biscuit] .

It was a disaster for me, I got the total of 1hr 5 mins kip between 11pm and 8am, was in a seriously bad mood in the morning and did not see the fun side of it at all.  Seven nights I've booked myself in for and if I had to spend 7 consecutive nights with minimal sleep I'd be driving myself home by the end of day 2!  I cannot function without my sleep, I get really grumpy and moody and a desire to be on my own.  I certainly couldn't think about a day trip out after spending 10 mins trying to get up off a bloody airbed and that's before I've even thought about getting dressed!

I'm considering options, one of which is not going at all and allowing DH to spend the week with his family and DD.  Upside is that I would get a week to myself as my other DD is away abroad at the same time.

Another is to check into a hotel close by and swing in by each morning with some lovely breakfast items for them all and spend the day with them.  Upside is there will be a lovely bathroom in the hotel, just for me, a cosy bed, a bar under cover and I won't have to make my bed in the morning because some lovely person will do it for me.   More my idea of relaxation.

Other option is to borrow our friend's caravan (she has offered it in my hour of need!) and add a caravan pitch to our booking.  That way we have a tent and a caravan.  I could cope with a caravan - I think.

1256,"Is it a less old extension (ie not Victorian) - is it solid walls or could it be cavity? - that would be easy! 
(Parent's house was built in 1819 - walls are 2ft thick stone and actually quite warm but one bedroom with three external walls is an extension (originally to house a bathroom) built in late 1800s/early 1900s, solid brick walls - not so warm and ideally needs external insulation...also has a separate attic space - but really small  (my dad got me at 11yo crawling in there to lay the insulation cos he was too big! child labour [shock]!) 
To insulate solid wall is a bit of a nightmare (you loose inches off the inside, use insulated plasterboard on a frame and need to redecorate), can do external (if it is rendered) but that's quite (very) expensive.
First things to do...
Check for draughts... 
you can go round windows etc with a candle flame and look for flame moving
Check around edges of floor are sealed (esp if it is a suspended floor - floorboards) - and you can insulate under this - esp important if it is a ground floor room (either need to get under or lift boards)
Check any fans etc have backdraught shutters - they close when fan isn't in use (people have been known to take them out  - cos they can rattle in the wind...I sealed mine up with tape and didn't use until I had a replacement cos someone had done that!)   
Also do you have recessed spot lights - are they sealed units? They shouldn't be covered with insulation in attic space - if they aren't sealed you can get hoods  (or make plasterboard boxes or use ceramic flowerpots apparently) and then you can insulate over them...

Can/is the roof space insulated - get that done if you can ...(might be why DP is talking about another ceiling? Modern guide lines are a depth of 270mm rockwool - slimmest way you do that is using celotex/kingspan board - I think you need 120mm depth (plus 12mm plasterboard) - and not cheap but you can get seconds (do a web search for kingspan seconds or not seconds from bulder's merchants if nec ask a local builder/handyman if he has an account- don't get it from B&Q/Wickes etc -they charge crazy prices!)  

Also do you have a towel rail radiator or radiator? - is it big enough for the space and outside walls?  (check BTUs - apparently towel rails (esp chrome) are a bit rubbish as a source of heat... I have had a massive one fitted in my new house for a tiny bathroom with 3 internal walls - only way to make it provide enough heat for space apparently ...)

Finally - won't make bathroom warmer  -but if you can  put rockwool insulation all around your bath behind the panel - keeps water in bath warm for longer and (but this could just be because I THINK it should!) seems to make metal baths feel warmer...

This is often disregarded and everything 'blamed' on the epidural. It is possible to deliver baginally with an epidural or a spinal anaesthetic (and even whilst unconscious with no idea about pushing) the body is designed to expell) but it doesn't always work for a whole host of reasons. 
The OAA website gove a lot of good information, written by specialist obstetric anaesthetists, about labour epidurals specifically and a load of other stuff about pain relief in labour. It's under the labour pains website as mentioned above. It also give up to date references from peer reviewed journals. Several other sources I have read use data for 40years ago.

1313,"Hi, I'm new to all this so I don't know if this will all come out correctly or make sense. It might also be long, I'm very sorry.
I'm just feeling so incredibly lonely at the moment. I've been married for 2 years and have a 10 month old DD who is my shining star. She is the most wonderful like thing I've ever seen and I love every moment of being with her but, as I am sure you have all experienced, sometimes it can be really tough. 
She's such a good baby though, she really is. She mostly sleeps through the night and has such a lovely temperament. I am on maternity leave at the moment so the 'childcare' as it were falls to me. And I mean it REALLY falls to me. My husband has never been proactive with anything around the house and now that I have someone else to focus on that really shows.
I deal with general tidying, all cleaning, washing and ironing, admin and paperwork, any phone calls and organisation that needs to be made for anything (including Any appointments DH might need). I am also the breadwinner, despite being on maternity leave as DH job is minimum wage. It is a job he enjoys, however. I suppose what I'm trying to highlight is that the responsibility is on me for everything and there is a general attitude (or so I feel) that my money is 'our' money but his money is 'his' money. I should feel like it is all one pot, but I don't. 
I wouldn't mind this if my DH pulled his weight a little more with things. He never did one night feed but was quite content to see me struggle on about two hours sleep a night. I remember one night where DD started screaming about 11pm (she was a colicky baby) and he simply looked at me and stated ""well, I'm up for work in the morning, I better turn in."" She was about 6 weeks old.
There are loads of other things I could mention- when he invited his whole family round on different days in the first week she was born without even asking me and expected me to play hostess, when he wanted to go to a BBQ at BIL house 8 days after she was born and I said no as I wanted to sleep and my stitches were hurting but he got his own way anyway, how he ruined her first Christmas for me (which I had spent a lot of time, effort and money sorting on my own) by sitting on his own in another room because he had ""flu"" (he had a cold.) How when DD was ill two weeks ago and I spent a week by her side with DM 24/7 for him to shun us and, again, sit in another room because HE didn't want to get ill. How he left to go to work at this time and was called back because it looked like she might have to go to hospital and when he was called back he completely ignored us and refused to give me a hug (I was frantic) and we had quite obviously inconvenienced him! etc, etc.
I have tried talking to him many times and things do seem to change for about two weeks and he makes such grand gestures and promises only for things to slide again. He has also taken to coming to bed after me as he is watching his TV programmes and needs his ""me"" time ans I am exhausted after a long day of play with the little one.
I'm feeling particularly down tonight as we've had a couple of days which has really highlighted how under appreciated I feel. A friend has just had a baby and her husband is working so hard to make sure she rests and has basically taken over night feed duty- my Wednesday consisted of being told I could either look after DD or sort out the evening chores. I was tired and emotional after two very hard weeks and just once I want my DH to just say- don't worry, I've got it tonight. You get in the bath.
Now I know I was so wrong for even thinking that was a possibility (and this was the day after we had a conversation about his selfishness regarding when DD was ill) so what actually happened was I ended up washing/drying up, washing floors, bleaching bathrooms and hanging up washing whilst he got to play with DD. All this is made worse by the fact that I have a bad back caused by giving birth to DD for which I am awaiting PT and can be quite debilitating. I was sobbing in pain into my washing up.
Maybe I am expecting too much, I don't know if it's even a reasonable and feasible request to get a little time to relax. I just feel really blue and feel like I've screamed so loudly and DH just hasn't listened to me. I don't think it's malicious I just think he is possibly a little selfish and I just never saw it before DD came along. I also feel that if he loved me like he said he does he would step up and not sit back and watch his wife hobble and struggle so.
I think I might be blowing it out of all proportion as I think I may have some PND in the background of all this but no one has really noticed and I don't really want to make a fuss.
Thank you if you have got this far, I know this is all very boring as I read these threads and most of you have such real problems and I have just wasted your time. I don't even really know what I want from you all, maybe just a hug?",2015-03-01 02:50:00+00:00,2320283,Feeling alone,relationships

'8 Signs of Narcissistic Rage
Narcissistic rage and its destructive consequences.'
Posted Jul 08, 2018

(extract)
""Psychologist Stephen Johnson writes that the narcissist is someone who has “buried his true self-expression in response to early injuries and replaced it with a highly developed, compensatory false self.” This alternate persona to the real self often comes across as grandiose, “above others,” and self-absorbed.

Narcissistic rage can be defined as intense anger, aggression, or passive-aggression when a narcissist experiences a setback or disappointment, which shatters his (or her) illusions of grandiosity, entitlement, and superiority, and triggers inner inadequacy, shame, and vulnerability.

Examples of narcissistic rage range from intense outbursts and sudden fits of anger, to passive-aggressive acts such as simmering resentment, icy silence, deliberate neglect, or cutting sarcasm. What distinguishes narcissistic rage from normal anger is that it is usually unreasonable, disproportional, and cuttingly aggressive (or intensely passive-aggressive), all because the narcissists’ wants and wishes are not being catered to. It is a blow to their superficial, idealized self-image.

It is important to note that not all angry outbursts are narcissistic."" (continues)

1339,"Mirage, I'm sure you've thought about all this, and sorry if I offend you at all, I don't mean to, but are you sure that your children are big enough to ride a 14.2?  I don't know how big you and DH are, but if DH has any weight at all it will need to be fairly cobby to carry him, and natives can be quite strong and wide for little legs.  Also, my experience was that the transition from riding lessons to own pony is a bit like when you've passed your driving test and start driving by yourself if you see what I mean.

My 14.2 mare, who I bought in Feb, was originally bought by my friend to share with her 8 year old and the pony was just too big for her to do anything other than lead rein on hacks, or ride in the indoor school. It was very demoralising for her daughter.  

My GD (tall, nearly 12, ridden since age 4, and very confident) is just outgrowing her 13.3hh fine boned pony who she's had for nearly 2 years, and we're starting to consider what to get next. Logically, it will need to be a 14.2, but we're hanging on as long as possible. She won't be riding my native pony out as she's too strong for her to manage if things went wrong.

Sorry to be a doubter, and tell me to mind my own business, but could you maybe think about a pony for the kids and one for the adults?  Possibly loan/share?",2011-05-02 10:50:53+00:00,1204813,Anyone got a 14.2 pony for loan / sale?,the_tack_room

It cannot in the nature of things happen after the baby is out and unless either baby or mum is then in need of resuscitation it wouldn't actually get in the way at all, would it? Skin on skin isn't something that the doctors have to ^do^ instead of their job, it is just about leaving the mother and baby to get on with it at one end whilst the doctor are getting on with their job at the other end. They have to plonk that baby down ^somewhere^, so why does it matter to them ^where^ they plonk it? 

The majority of emergency sections do not actually involve mothers and babies who need resuscitation after the event; the fact that a few do is not relevant to the rest.

Ds in starting yr13 is thinking of putting Durham as his possible insurance. His predictions are above what Durham is asking (AAB).

How many of you (I.e your dc’s of course) chose Durham as insurance AND did they get an offer?
How flexible was Durham with grades attained on results day?

1374,"Thanks *@CC81* for sharing your similar experience. The uncertainty is awful!! I think this is what’s happened to me (possibly caused by my own stressing too!) I’ve always been ovulating around day 10/11 and have consistently had 26/27 day cycles. But this month I had a peak at day 10 and then another (stronger) peak at day 14, so I think it was a failed ovulation attempt the first time. I’m on CD30 now which I suppose is totally consistent with my ovulation being 3-4 days later than normal this cycle. I haven’t had a 30 day cycle since immediately after I came off the pill in Jan 2016 though!
Now I’m also worried that I’ve had my tests done during a strange cycle for me with a double LH surge and that might skew the results.
I’m having some bad cramps now so think AF is likely coming. Either that or I’ve just made myself terribly ill worrying! Need to try and chill out but it’s so hard. 

My understanding of low ovarian reserve (which I researched after I got my disappointing AMH results) is that it makes pregnancy less likely each month but also still entirely possible because you only need one good egg to become pregnant. So it could still happen. I read lots of stories on here of women with incredibly low AMH / high FSH who’d still become pregnant - either naturally or via IVF. Hopefully the private clinic can provide a lot more detail / reassurance for you. 
I wish this were easier! Maybe best to try and accept it might be a long road and be grateful for other things. I really struggle to get ttc off my mind at all though 😭",2020-08-17 10:54:33+00:00,3979765,TTC 35+ Thread 4 Cougar and Silver Fox Club,conception

Since the frer is super-duper sensitive, did it pick up the earliest traces of HCG given out by the blastocyst much earlier in the pregnancy than other HPTs? Therefore meaning you conceived a few days earlier and putting the pregnancy at an early enough stage that the sac is still all that can be seen?

The people at the EPU must see this fairly often so if they're saying it's just too early then it probably is?

The other thing I wondered... People use OPKs as pregnancy tests right because of the similarity in the chemical structure of LH and HCG? Is it possible for the frer to actually have picked up the LH surge and so conception did happen after your BFP?

So I am a single 20-something young lady, the eldest of my siblings and I was born into a poor family in the UK (we have to survive off of benefits). I have to live off of disability benefits.

Now onto the nitty gritty.

Following a particularly harrowing few years my mum (who is also on benefits) has had another mental breakdown and is struggling very hard to look after my youngest siblings who are still children. My mum always has struggled with caring for us - I have lots of traumatic memories from when I was a kid - but now she has behaviour episodes which are becoming increasingly alarming. 

I want to adopt my younger siblings and protect them so they won't have to have the kind of childhood I had and I don't want them to end up in the care system. Problem is, like I said before, I have to live on disability benefits.

Does anyone know what kind of funding I would be able to get to make sure they have enough food and a decent quality of life? And do I have to go through the courts to become their legal guardian?

1456,"I can so relate to this 

I've had weight issues since my teens and am very conscious of my size, but I have been more or less the same for the last 20 years.

I have this thing about not wanting to know how much I weigh, I know that if I can put a number to it, I'll become totally preoccupied with the weight, rather than just being happy with my shape and how I fit into my clothes, IYKWIM. So we don't own a weighing scales, and don't want one! But I can fit into size 10 topshop skinny jeans, so that's fine with me.

The problem is that when you are pregnant, doctors/midwives become obsessed with your weight, this bothered me so much during my first pregnancy, that during the next two, I always asked whoever was weighing me just to write it in my records and not tell me. That worked fine until just before my c-section for my last baby the mv let it slip that I was 13.5 stone - I nearly fainted I knew I was bigger with this pregnancy than the others, but not that much!

BUT, without starving myself or anything ridiculous, the extra weight disappeared fairly rapidly after each baby - so much of it was just fluid, and while I wasn't back in skinny jeans the day after the birth, my body was pretty much back to it's normal shape within 6 weeks.

As long as you are reasonable about what you eat, and don't use pregnancy as an excuse to eat cream cakes every day, it will be FINE, don't worry.

Keep your eye on the prize - a healthy baby, and only look in mirrors from the waist up for the next while.

1472,"Oh, and if you think I do, could I have some suggestions please?

Guy at work, let’s call him Bill, late 20’s and a real --attention seeker-- joker.

Me and another male colleague collected some items from a store cupboard at the start of our shift this evening. Pretty standard part of our work.
Bill comes into the store cupboard also and starts saying ‘oh, there’s a weird atmosphere in here, like I almost caught you two kissing or something’ and ‘what’s been going on in here the hey?!’ Etc.

I felt embarrassed but just smiled and left.

I’m a married woman in my late 40’s (so maybe I’m just not down with the ‘bantz’ or whatever) and the other colleague is the same age as Bill, but painfully shy.

I just ^know^ he’s going to make a big ‘joke’ out of this later when everybody is gathered waiting to clock off. I know because he does similar things to other people. Calling for everyone’s attention so he can tell his funny story about Janet from the kitchen and getting lots of laughs while poor Janet just stands there trying to laugh it off.

I will probably have to stand there red faced for a good few minutes whilst he shares his suspicions of what me and other colleague were up to.

I wish I was one of those people who could have a witty comeback at the ready, but I’m not.

It’s fair to say I don’t like Bill. One reason being that I had to take some time off work last year as my baby grandson passed away.
My colleagues had a collection for me to cover any loss of earnings, which was so nice of them. 
Bill put £5 into this collection.

Upon my return to work Bill asked me if I’d ‘paid any nice bills’ with the money from the collection [hmm]
and I had to explain to him that I’d put it towards the funeral expenses.
He went on to say ‘oh, you must have got a fair bit then, how much was it in the end?’ [confused] 
I felt like giving him his fiver back.

Maybe I’m being over sensitive and Bill is just a bit immature but I’m dreading clocking off now.

They are both bright boys but we don't want an extremely pushy school. Rather one that stimulates them academically but also makes them feel good about themselves and helps with their confidence.  I was wondering if any mumsnetters with first hand experience on either school might be kind enough to offer feedback on them. 

I specifically would like to know:

- How are they regarded from an academic point of view?
- Do they prepare for Grammar or a different path?  If aimed towards the grammars, is the education well rounded or is it very channelled into just passing the exams
- Are they good value for money?  From what I have seen, the fees are largely similar?
- Are they happy nurturing schools?
- I understand they're not selective, but do they stream?
- Do they follow the National Curriculum?

Any other comments, postive or otherwise would be greatly appreciated. Obviously we will visit both schools, I just wanted some 'unofficial' information before we do so.

1553,"I wasn't expecting a water birth but was happy when I arrived at the mlu and the midwife said I have filled the pool for you if you want. I was fully dilated when I arrived so only had the pool for the pushing stages. The water helped but I think the position I was able to stay in whilst in the pool helped more - on my knees mostly upright occasionally leaning on the side of the pool. I think if I was to do it again this is the bit I would try to replicate with or without the pool.

When to go into hospital is a tricky one, I left it quite late but had the luxury of only being 10 minutes from the hospital. I went in the first time at 2 cm (3 contractions in 10 minutes and lasting one minute each) before I was sent home I was asked how far away I was and how easy it was to get back in. As you are an hour away I would definitely make them aware of this as I think they factor this in their decision to allow you to stay or not. 

How quick was your last labour? Mine was a little over 3h and my midwives have warned me that next time might be quicker and to head to the hospital earlier. 

I had to stay in for 72h for monitoring whilst I would have preferred to be at home, it wasnt as bad as I was expecting. We did have fairly good visiting (8-8) so it was only over night that my partner couldn't be there.

Being the car whilst in labour isnt the best feeling in the world. In the earlier stages it was uncomfortable but manageable and in the later stages it was bordering on unmanageable but so was being at home. Having something to grip hold of helped (I used the handle above the window). Try to use a route that has the least bumps/speed bumps and any stop/starts if possible even if it is slightly longer. I think the motion of the car helped and it was worse when we were stopped at junctions.

I didn't but other mums from my antenatal class took things in with them to make the room feel more like home - smelly room scent sprays, battery operated candles, fairly lights music. I think they are more aware these days that there is a difference between being at home and being on the ward and that small things can make the difference.",2020-09-18 13:16:43+00:00,4026904,"Those who've had a water birth, how would you feel about not being able to have one again?",pregnancy

1578,"*@Comfysofa78* When my DD was out of school and did not want to engage with the world, I found local home ed groups with meet ups, where we found the children had a very friendly and welcoming attitude and would take dd off to play.
Also, meeting up 1:1 with a few particular friends. 
Small steps - showed her how her expectations and the reality were very far apart: that she was not 'weird' and got on with anybody and everybody, was a kind and fun friend. Self- esteem building.
Again, making lists.
We would do things such as:
Words to describe myself and my personality.
What makes me happy?
Who makes me happy? How?
What makes me sad?
Who makes me sad? Why?

She found that her negative attributes (we all have them) list was much smaller than her positive qualities.
What she enjoyed much more than a small number of things that upset her.
More people and children that she got on with well than didn't.

We did this a few times over 4months, which got her started and in a good place to even think about going back to school; then school visit, tentative positivity, then bumpy reality for a couple of terms with a small level of refusal and fear - deep breathing, comics, blowing soap bubbles on way to school. A positive experience would be a small powerful building block to help build confidence back.

Also, with lists - what did she want for her future? How could we work towards getting there?

It's a lot of things - identifying triggers and physical response, rationalising, distraction, coping, facing up to! (the hardest but most powerful tool), talking things through, relaxation, fun, *good* *sleep* (we employed audio books at bedtime to avoid fretting at night), walks and fresh air.

1) ignore the behaviour initially. Giving him attention (even the nevative sort like shouting/screaming/long response email) will fuel the fire.

2) after a small delay, send a calm, dignified and neutral reply that does not apologise but acknowledges his distress and encourages him to respond in a more mature manner. Eg ""I'm sorry that you have been distressed by our naming decision. It's something that DH and I have agreed between us and reflects and acknowledges both our backgrounds, which is important to us.
Do let us know when you would like to come and get to know your grandson, we'd love to see you.""

That doesn't mean the children were unloved, or came from a 'traumatised'  home, it just meant a certain person wasn't able to cope with the responsibilties of being a parent.

I knew somebody at a very young age that put her child up for adoption, because she felt she couldn't offer her a good home, and it was the hardest choice of her life - and 20 years on she still cries over her choice, but stands by her decscision - we were very young x",2013-11-06 20:32:19+00:00,1902260,Are these the right motivations?

1706,"^is there such a thing as a solicitor who specialises in helping abused people get away from their abusive marriages?^

Yes.  I had one for my divorce.  She was recommended by a legal advice service I get through work.  If you're in the UK, give WA a call on 0808 2000 247 and see if they have recommendations for solicitors in your area who have dealt with such cases before.  
My lawyer was worth her weight in gold.  It made the process so much easier to have a pro dealing with exH's shit.  I heart good lawyers as a result.

But be aware that a solicitor is NOT a counsellor or a psychologist.  A good one will let you know your options, and then let you choose which one to go for.  Their terrain is legal and factual, not emotional.  It's actually a great way to make the process LESS emotionally fraught, to deal with it with a professional who only cares about the facts and legalities.  Mine thankfully understood why I appeared like a weak and indecisive wreck at times, but our interactions were all business.  She also was NOT impressed by exH's shenanigans, and understood they came from a place of domination and control, so she was ready to respond with the legalities that kept him at bay.

Ask WA for a recommendation.  And while you're on the phone with them, see what they can tell you about refuges in case you do ever need to flee, as well as peer support groups, which are great for the feelings of emotional overwhelm.

You will get through this.  Good luck.",2016-05-25 19:26:34+00:00,2646105,please help! want to leave abusive husband,relationships

Dear <HR or H&S rep>

I am concerned we do not have a trained first aider at work. Although I know we are not legally required to have one, I strongly feel that having a trained first aider at work would be beneficial to the business. 
If anyone had an accident (such as the accident I had on XXX) a trained first aider would be able to do an initial quick assessment and if necessary treatment. This could be cost effective as otherwise A&E or doctors visits might be needed etc.
Additionally your employees would feel more confident and happy at work as they would feel you are taking our safety more seriously.
If there were a serious accident at work with no first aider, I am also concerned at the time lost due to H&S executive inquiries etc.
A suitable training course from the Red Cross would only cost XXX and take Y days. 
I would really appreciate it if this could be considered

40g caster sugar
300ml double cream
300ml milk or in your case cream
4 tablespoons baileys or to taste (I shove a lot more in)

Grease your dish.

Butter the bread of your choice and arrange in the dish overlapping a bit with each piece. 

Sprinkle the fruit over

Beat the egg yolks, whole eggs and sugar together until creamy and then beat in the cream/milk and baileys. Slowly pour this over the bread.

Press the bread down gently with your fingers so it is submerged.

Leave to stand for about 20 mins to allow the bread to soak up the custard.

Before putting in the oven, sprinkle with the demerara sugar.

Stand your dish in a roasting tin filled halfway up with water. 

Put in the oven at 180c or 160 fan or gas 4 and bake for around 40 mins until golden. I usually cover with foil for around 30 mins of this time and then let it brown for the last 10 mins.

Then we go to an 'adult restaurant' There is no colouring sheets, no crayons and I have 2 perfectly behaved children...

1781,"A few things that haven’t been widely discussed here: 

1. If schools go back on June 1 and are staggered, they break up only 6 weeks later for summer, private schools maybe only 4or 5, even less for the year groups that go back last.  It gives good chance to see what happens without having to cause panic of a second shutdown because they know closure is coming anyway. Likewise if someone can’t work for six weeks without getting stressed to the point of leaving as was suggested upthread then perhaps they’re in the wrong job?

2. Most primary schools at least do pretty much nothing of academic substance that term anyway so again it makes for a good test case to see how many staff and teachers will come in and how it can be managed for September 

3. Many teachers in cities depend on public transport to get to school, that’s likely to present as much of a risk as being in school for some

4. By opening schools you de facto allow holiday clubs to open for summer holidays, otherwise that means no childcare provision for another three months

5. I’m starting to think that there won’t be much difference in September as spread will have picked up again, so we need a long term solution. Agree it’s not realistic for  people to expect to be paid in the long term, i see this half term as a dry run for September 

6. Like any workplace there will be people who are committed to their job and will do everything they can to make it work, and there Will be people who are not. 

7. Now that there’s a platform in place I don’t think that there’s any reason for teachers not to be able to upload work for children who don’t come in. Just adjust lesson plans and resources to take into account that you will probably need to.

I haven’t decided whether or not to send kids in if schools go back. Currently I do homeschool / childcare in the daytime and I’m spending until midnight and weekends on my own work whilst DH has kids.

Naturally she has the right to ask to be called by her full name, but to not be aware people are being friendly and not being 'mean' to her, just because they give her a shortened name out of friendship not harm?  I think there are much, much deeper issues at play here if a kid is that traumatised by it they don't want to go to school (unless she is being bullied of course or teased), and I wonder how much this is the girl feeling pressure to have people call her the full name and how much of this is the mother.",2020-12-04 04:04:43+00:00,4096125,Teachers need to use the correct name.,am_i_being_unreasonable

1812,"Hi there *Maredebois* and welcome. 

Some thoughts....If you are a classic' then that essentially is what you must be but you can ring some changes by looking at texture and colour. If you like a classic navy cardigan then look at unusual weaves and knits (Stella very good for this). Look for changes in cut- dropped shoulders, bracelet sleeves worn with a different colour skinny thin T underneath. Look at unusual pleating (Marni are great at this), embellishment (Marni again) and different lengths. Look for colours you wouldn't normally wear but like and buy them as inexpensive T's that you can try out without wasting a lot of cash if you find they aren't feeling 'you'. I love a flash of deep pink or Fuschia under a navy sweater or top, a flash of orange under Olive and deep red with olive green. 

Same with pants. If you like a skinny cut then try on some skinny pants in different fabrics and colours. Try a mercurised cotton for Summer in a smoke blue or Airforce blue or a soft grey. Not too much of a change from a jean- won't frighten the horses so to speak until you get used to it. Experiment with Sailor pant cuts too -they look lovely with skinny T's or slouchy ones. Dark Olive Green is a more offbeat classic shade and lovely in the Summer and looks good with a Breton top.

1837,"I never thought I would be posting about this. I have to get it all out. I feel like I am carrying it for everyone. 

It's long.  DB was sectioned in 2004 and dx with schizophrenia.  Since then he has lived:

1. At home - behaviours led to arguments with DF, moved by SW to shared flat

2. Shared flat- had criminal hiding there on one occasion, moved to independent flat

 3. Independent accommodation - targeted by drug user who ""moved in"". I got involved, SW helped and he was moved to a different town

4. Private rented - relatively stable period, 1st floor flat, massive damp problems

5. Housing Association - ground floor flat, GF broke up with him, debt and drug spiral, victim of cuckooing

This is over a period of 15 years.  During this time, he has amassed a network of ""friends"" who constantly borrow money of each other, 80% are alcoholics and 20% are drug users.  He has never been in trouble with the Police before.

Today I found out he stole my credit card and spent 600 on it. 

I have had the worst day and feel utterly exhausted, shaken and broken.

I've reported it to the Police. We discussed all the options and are going down the mediatory/caution route.  

I would like to use a victim mediation service as well. 
  
My question is, in light of what I've described above, do you think I should write to adult social services with my concerns for his vulnerability?

He is lonely and doesn't have structured activity that he truly enjoys, and is going down a bad path to try and gain status among friends. I think he has undiagnosed learning issues (autism?). He doesn't listen to family - maybe he will listen to the police though I fear it's just going to get forgotten as soon as the next ""friend"" comes along.  

Its just too desperately sad.

He has had no involvement with SS for a long time, as he is stable, takes his meds, accesses support through a mental health charity (currently he has an advocate).

I am not sure what more social services could do. 

I asked DM if she would write a letter and she said what about me and the impact its having on my mental state, how much anxiety it is causing me.

Should DF and myself write a letter to adult social services about his situation? Almost every place he has lived, he has been abused. 

He uses drugs and alcohol but isn't an addict.  I just want him safe and out of trouble/prison.  

It's so wierd because on paper he sounds horrendous but to meet him he is a gentle, sensitive soul. I can't keep making excuses for him though.

Why can't I not care? My parents sometimes tell me what a good job I have done in supporting him when I tell them it has affected my mental health. I do know from reading mumsnet boards this is quite minimising. He is my only sibling. 

We used to bail him out financially but my parents/we stopped all that now.

This is a bit all over the place - it has truly been the worst day, having to discuss with the police what action to take. No family member should ever have to go through that [flowers]

Any advice appreciated. I wish I knew it had a happy ending. It doesn't, does it? 

How do I even face him? 

I have a really busy week ahead at work.

1838,"Unfortunately, *Ken*, your two provisos: ""with the right help/support"" and ""where are all these jobs going to come from"" are not theoretical issues. 

The government withdrew funding from Remploy, the largest and most successful organisation that got disabled people into work, which has now had to close. DLA, which provides financial help for disabled people to get support, has been cut down and is being replaced with the much harsher PIP system. The Social Fund is being closed. ""Help and support"" are being cut off, not extended.

There are nine healthy people for every job vacancy (including unsocial and zero-hour jobs.) When signing on for JSA, people are required to state that they are fit for work. If they are not able to do a full-time job, they don't qualify for the benefit. 

This happens even when the DWP has declared a disabled person ""not disabled"" and fit for work. The claimant would have to lie to get JSA, and will then have their benefit stopped if they can't manage full-time work activity, on the Work Programme for example. The consequent benefit gap is the reason for many of the recent suicides.

should say

OldCrone, you might be interested in this :)

THE surgeon who carried out amputations on two physically healthy men has admitted he knew in advance that one of them ran an Internet website for people sexually interested in amputees.

Both patients were said to have had a condition called body dysmorphic disorder, a rare psychological condition which leads to sufferers focusing on a perceived imperfection of particular body parts.

The pair - one from England, the other from Germany - whose condition led them to feeling the only option was to have an amputation, were treated by consultant surgeon Robert Smith after being refused by doctors across Europe.

The two patients each had a lower leg removed at Falkirk and District Royal Infirmary - first Kevin Wright in 1997 and then a German in April last year.

But the Sunday Telegraph says Mr Wright, from Essex, is involved with a website called OverGround.

The website, which closed down last Wednesday, described itself as ''a support group for people who are attracted to those who have physical disabilities''.

Mr Smith told the newspaper that he would not have carried out the #1400 operation on Mr Wright if a sexual fetish had been a factor and denied he had been ''duped''.

''The website Mr Wright started was an information website and covered the whole spectrum of the problem, although Kevin's own problem was at the far right of the spectrum, those who want an amputation,'' said the surgeon.

''I looked at the website before I decided what I was going to do and I wanted to make sure that I was dealing with the right problem. I do not feel I have been duped.

''At the end of the day, I have done the right thing because the patient is extremely satisfied and has made a major lifestyle change for the better.''

Last week, the chairman of the NHS trust where the two operations were carried out described them as ''unacceptable''.

Mr Ian Mullen, chairman of Forth Valley Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, confirmed that no more private patients would be allowed the operation at the hospital. But patients within the trust area would be considered if the board gave prior approval, he added.

Mr Mullen confirmed he was not consulted over the treatment.

He said: ''Treating people from outside our catchment area and even bringing them in from abroad was inappropriate and it is regrettable and unacceptable that it was not discussed with me as chairman.

''The decision was taken by the then medical director on purely medical grounds and the trust board was not approached, something we are disappointed about.

''This has had a serious effect on the reputation of this hospital and the view people take of it.

Mr Mullen said Mr Smith had followed correct procedures at the time of the operations and no action would be taken against him.

I just heard an interview on my local station in the Midlands, but it's nationwide. 

My station called it a 'gender' imbalance, annoyingly.

They're still not sure why fewer males are stepping forward. There was some speculation men aren't hearing the message.

But I'd be interested to hear more on this if anyone knows.

Here's a piece from one day ago re Southwark: https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/shortage-of-male-blood-donors-in-southwark-causes-concern-concern/

'Some transfusions can only use men's blood

'Men’s blood is particularly important because it has higher iron levels.

This means men are less likely to be deferred when putting themselves forward due to low haemoglobin levels.

Men’s blood is also free from the antibodies women can produce during pregnancy – even very short pregnancies the woman may not be aware of.

Some transfusions can only use men's blood

More male blood donors are needed in Southwark to fix a “serious imbalance”, says the NHS.

Throughout 2019, only 38 per cent of new donors in the borough were men, reflecting a national trend of women being more likely to sign up.

Figures showing donor numbers from January 2019 to the end of November showed 516 women signing up – and just 322 men.


Men’s blood is particularly important because it has higher iron levels.

This means men are less likely to be deferred when putting themselves forward due to low haemoglobin levels.

Men’s blood is also free from the antibodies women can produce during pregnancy – even very short pregnancies the woman may not be aware of.


Antibodies are part of the body’s defence system, and make transfusions more difficult.

Because of this, only men’s blood can be used in some specialist transfusions and blood products including complete blood transfusions in newborn babies, and for plasma – used for patients who have had massive blood loss.

The NHS also gets 93 per cent of platelets – usually given for cancer patients to stop internal bleeding – from men.'

There's more, but it's yet another reminder why, despite all the glitter and rainbows in the world, biology is immutable.",2020-01-10 17:54:10+00:00,3791992,National shortage of male blood donors,womens_rights

Then how she acted when you saw her in a different capacity was very different. Why may that be? Something has brought her to that point and she sounds like she was in a bit of fight and flight mode herself. Anxious people make anxious people anxious. Although you may not agree with how the doctor handled it, it doesn’t mean it’s right or wrong. It’s just what happened. The other PP is right about her not being covered legally to give you advice in that situation. 

I think the main crux of your situation is that you felt that the second doctor didn’t listen. You didn’t feel cared for as you expected. And understandably you’re concerned.

1988,"To me, the issue with freedom of movement is that objections are always based on perceptions (however valid or mistaken) of how things are - right now - with zero sense of what the future might hold.

People are so used to living in a prosperous and reliable economy that they cannot any longer conceive of a future in which we - and our children - are not prosperous and secure and that our children might actually want the flexibility to relocate, even if they don't have earning capacity above whatever the new earnings threshold in these EU countries is likely to be (e.g. £35k per annum), or a specialist skill on an immigration skills list. 

Ours is an economy built largely on consumer spending and optimism, shored up by housing ""equity"" and credit card debt. And we depend on our currency remaining stable relative to other currencies.

So many people imagine freedom of movement rights only being exercised by Tabithas and Freddies on their gap year.

There is extraordinary complacency whenever this issue is raised, if ever. People like the PP who responded that she and her husband voted to leave the EU even though they have paid off their mortgage and have a nice house etc seem to have no awareness of freedom of movement in any other frame of reference than tabloid racism. 

Who do we think we are, that we can curtail these rights with so little regard for those most likely to be adversely affected?

[quote NailsNeedDoing]*They’re not though - women are treated much more harshly. Much more. Please don’t make me list all those examples of forgiven, abusive men again, and I’m sure I don’t have to - I’m sure you’re capable of thinking up a few of your own.*

Treated morse harshly by the media, I agree. But I don’t agree that they are treated more harshly than men by society, this thread proves that with the massive outpouring of sympathy that CF has received. If anything, the CF case proves how in some ways, women are already treated better. I don’t remember anyone questioning the mental health status of any of the men you mentioned earlier, and I completely disagree that any of them have been forgiven, as you put it.

*‘Equality’ isn’t the same as fairness though. We can’t treat male and female violence exactly the same because they’re often very, very different.*

They are different, but so are many many variations in cases of DV. They should all be treated according to their individual circumstances, and not be based on whether the aggressor was make or female.

*But reversing the roles doesn’t work for DV because we know women are treated much worse than men when they’re accused. Because people want to pretend women are just as bad, and they’re not.*

Treated worse by who? I’ve already said that I agree the media portrayal may be worse, and that is not ok, but you’re missing that the media isn’t everything. I don’t agree that women are treated worse by either society or the justice system, because they aren’t. 

Women as a group aren’t worse than men, you’re right, but individual women can be as bad as or worse than individual men. There are more individual men that have violent tendencies than individual women, but as we can recognise that untreated mental illness is a significant factor when a woman becomes violent, why can’t we recognise that untreated mental illness is also a significant factor when men become violent? How does it take anything away from women to recognise that many violent men will also be suffering from untreated mental illness?[/quote]
I don’t really know how much further we can go with this conversation if you think women are treated fairly in society.

But I do think it is ^perfectly^ all right to say ""I am very tired tonight, I need to go to sleep now"" or ""I am talking to your grandma just now"" of ""I have a bit of a headache, dear"", as long as this is not your default position. 

My whole take on the child-parent relationship is that we are ^both^ important. And I wouldn't think it ok to hang around my children's rooms and pester them for conversation if they were really tired or talking to their friends. 

Still, this leaves plenty of time for disseminating information and exchanging ideas; it's fun, it's something to be enjoyed.

Even if mum and dad pretend that their 13 year old ds can be left to his own devices (as most kids this age would be, mine included), this is not borne out in RL.
I wouldn't go as far as to say dss is sn, but I tried addressing the problem many years ago with dh. At the time he agreed dss had some developmental issues but that ""exw would definitely not hear of it!""
Now of course I'm thinking that it was actually dh who didn't want an ounce of criticism cast upon his offspring, although mum could of course have acted upon own initiative (but as you all say, it was none of my business, mums choice as dss lived with her full time then).
Only its affecting me now with the 50:50 split. As it stands, dss attends a school with extra long hours and dh is home by 6 at the latest.
If dss gets his way and attends a school with regular hours and dh is away pursuing his ambitions, then moi is left to deal with an awkward situation.

Thank you all again for letting me say this so directly and giving your opinion. It's the vague nature of dss behaviour (I suspect autism/ aspergers) and his parents unwillingness to address this that makes it impossible for me to take over more responsibility.

Phew! jammed packed week of adventure. We went Andaman side, but way down south, further than I have ever been before...and well worth it! Much more wild and less resorty. We flew to Phuket, then Hat Yai, bus to Pak Barra, loaded sea kayaks onto the ferry to Koh Lipe and started paddling to our first campsite on Koh Rawi all in one day. Slept very well Monday night! We then paddled around the Koh Adang-Koh Rawi archipelago, covering about 40km per day, camping on beaches without another soul to be seen...just lovely! NO doof doof music, no touts, just peace (and a few paddling blisters from the large distances we covered). Highly recommend this island group, but take longer than we did. Happiness! [grin]

Not really, there is a lot of information out there now about healthy eating and I think that food in supermarkets are generally marked more clearly now. I'm pretty good at reading labels for food and we always cook from scratch so I more or less know what is in the meals I make. 

- Is providing your family with a healthy and balanced diet something that you feel confident about? If so why, if not, why not?

""Consent in prostitution is pay to rape"" as a blanket statement in consideration of all possible punter/prostitute situations is offensive, legally incorrect and morally wrong! 

Also, if ""punters know this"" within the context of your message, how come you mention ""altruistic punters"" or ""Mr Nice Guy"" punter who I am sure you understand to be he who deludes himself into thinking the girl actually likes him. You must be aware that some punters are so emotionally detached from reality and actually do believe that they can buy not only sex, but respect also. If you accept the ""deluded punter"" argument then you must also accept his lack of knowledge in any harm he may do as a consequence, actually to both parties.

To be clear here, my argument is that you are correct in [b]some[/b] circumstances but certainly not all where as you (and others) seem to want to tar every ""punter"" with the exact same brush. Remove this from your argument, accept that punters vary in countless ways and the labelling of such is actually unfortunate and then I agree that in far too many cases you are 100% correct (just not in 100% of cases or circumstances, nowhere near in fact).

2168,"Agree with the PP who said use Ryanair's online chat rather than phoning or emailing, I have found them very useful.

Ryanair's luggage policy is quite easy if you break it down, it just seems complicated when you first look at it.

If you pay for a Ryanair seat you get to take a small bag on board with you. Although they do give max dimensions for this bag I have found them to be fairly flexible about it. As long as it's squashy and fits under the seat in front they are usually OK with it. 

Once you've got your basic seat and small bag you have 3 further options. 

1) you pay £8-12 for a small checked bag which is cabin-bag-sized and must weigh under 10kg. You check this in at the desk when you arrive at the airport, and only your small bag goes through security and onto the plane with you.

2) for a similar price you can get priority boarding. This is limited to 100 places per flight, and means you get to take a 10kg cabin bag onto the aircraft with you and put it in the overhead locker. With this option you bypass the checkin desk and your bag goes through airport security with you. 

3) You pay more (£25-40) to take a 20kg checked bag with you. If you do this, the pricing structure means that sometimes your bag costs more than your seat.

Note that you can combine priority boarding with a 20kg bag, but you can't combine a 10kg checkin bag with a 20kg one. You also can't combine priority boarding with a 10kg bag and effectively take 2 10kg bags with you.

All the luggage options are cheaper if you do them when you book rather than add them on afterwards. If you're comparing Ryanair prices with other airlines on a particular route you need to factor this in when deciding if they offer you best value or not.

Hope that helps.",2019-06-05 22:55:48+00:00,3603903,Does anyone work for Ryanair? I have a luggage question.,_chat

Sooooo impressed with your progress, well done!  So many inspiring stories on here.
Can I ask about your homemade pizza?  I discovered bread making during lockdown (used to make bread but stopped a few years back) and my pizza dough is delicious.  I want to still be able to do this so I'm very glad to see you are eating this *and* losing all that weight![/quote]
*@Roussette* I am sure my pizza base is nowhere near as nice as yours, because it is made from wholemeal flour and dairy-free yoghurt mainly. I add in seasoning like garlic granules. It is nice, but it isn't a ""real"" pizza base. It suits me fine though, it is enough of a change from my weekday dinners to feel like a treat. I'll find the exact recipe I use, it's on my phone somewhere - I am on laptop at the moment.

I eat loads of carbs but mainly porridge, potatoes and rice. Pasta the odd day. I buy brown/wholemeal/wholegrain now, never the white alternative. My pizza is the only time I use flour now.  I have no sugar/energy spikes any more- I very rarely eat between my meals and if I do, it's a piece of fruit. I often skip breakfast because I am not hungry, so I am accidentally doing 16:8 some days.

It was handled so well that it was only immediately afterwards when they were resuscitating him that it all hit me and I truly thought he was dead.

2285,"I started running about a year and a half ago. In that time I've been stopped about 6 or so times. I always stop and help, mostly because I'm usually the only one around. I live in a village (with lots of other villages dotted around) and tend to run around the outskirts. I don't necessarily get annoyed but I do cry a little inside and I do lose my rhythm, momentum and motivation. In fact the first time it happened to me, I puffed and panted for a good while and even apologised to the person who had stopped me as I just couldn't speak.

I always move over for other people, often finding myself in the road. Always thanks others who move over for me and would never dream of barging past anyone.

Like others have said... I'm not a natural runner, I find it hard work and it takes all my willpower to not just give up like my lungs and legs want me to. So I do find it incredibly difficult to start up again once stopped.

I started running to lose weight, I continue to run to keep my weight in check. And even though it's hard it's my excersise of choice because it's the only one I've been able to stick to.

2287,"Okay, I've put my Oprah hat on.

I'd like to have asked Meghan if she had a message for the British people because she left the UK without saying anything - except thanking Canada! There was a feeling of disgruntlement with people left hanging in the air but nothing was explicitly said. I know she thought the press racist but it would have been good to have some clarifying comments on her feelings about the British people.

The allegations around racism within the royal family are probably the statements most in need of further elucidation. I understand not naming the person who spoke to Harry but, given the differing accounts supplied, I would like clarity on whether it was one conversation or several and if it was when Meghan was a girlfriend or when she was pregnant. Was the tone of this person hostile or musing and curious? How did Harry react at the time? Did he let the person know he found what they said inappropriate and what was the response if so?  Does this person have form for such comments or was it out of character and does Harry think their attitude/conduct is in any way reflective of the royal family as a whole?  

Yes, I would have loved to have had a more detailed account of the racist incident/incidents.

Take a look at your current kitchen right now, and think about what is not working with it - e.g. is there a lot of stuff that hasn't been put away because there isn't a good place for it? When you open a cupboard, can you see and get out everything you need straight away, or do you have to pull things out to get at the things at the back, and then put the first things back in the cupboard as well? 

We just bought a new kitchen, and spent a fortune on the cabinets, and skimped on the worktops, which is exactly what everyone tells you not to do - because you can fit far, far more stuff in in series of drawers (more expensive) than you can in a cupboard taking up the same amount of space, and, long term, we would rather have the space and ease of use in the kitchen than posh worktops. 

This is the second galley kitchen we've had re-fitted, and having seen what an amazing effect better storage had on the previous kitchen, there was no way we were going back to having cupboards.

That said, I've heard very good things about Ikea kitchens, and if we hadn't known exactly what we wanted, might have gone for them this time.

Honestly, if you aren't comfortable with your son taking the train, I'd have a hard think about whether you're signing yourselves up to a really gruelling school drive and whether any school is worth that.  
Very few RGS boys will come from Reading.  A small number might come from Wokingham and it's surprisingly quick on the train. Even if there aren't many boys on the train that far down the line, they will join in much larger numbers by places like Farnborough.  There will then be loads of them walking up from Guildford mainline station.
The school doesn't do any organised transport and I doubt you'll find many (if any..........) parents wanting to do a car/taxi share with you as the train is so much quicker.

2298,"If you could somehow find a way to know, not just logically, but to feel it in your heart, that the fact that they treated you as unimportant/less important than other people, does not mean it is true. If you could find a way of explaining this to yourself, in words which really make sense to you - I often think 'enlightenments' come from people putting things in certain words which really make you understand, even though people have said the same things in different words at other times, some ways of explaining just really make things click into place.

I don't get the impression it is your sisters' faults half as much as it is your parents' fault as they have been influenced/taught by your parents how to treat you. And they made you feel so crap about yourself that you are now sensitive to anything which looks like someone treating you as unimportant and you may be interpreting everything that people do as being 'against' you, even some things that won't have crossed your sisters' minds as being potentially hurtful to you. I'm not saying they never do anything that anyone would find hurtful, but that you may be getting hurt by more things than just those things.

If they are much closer in age to what you are to them, then it may be quite natural that they would be more 'together' than you are with them as they will identify with each other more and be more at the same 'life stage'. They may not be doing it on purpose to make you feel left out. I can see how it would make you feel isolated and left out and less valued though. 

From things you've said before I feel that if your parents hadn't encouraged this by their behaviour when you were growing up then it wouldn't be such a big problem now. If *they* hadn't made you feel inferior to your sisters at that time in your life then you wouldn't have the fixation with making your sisters treat you as equal now. It's like you've realised your parents are never going to make you feel equal and have given up on them but now you are still trying with your sisters.

You may be thinking that if your sisters started treating you equally to the way they treat each other that this would 'cure' your feelings of not being important enough or good enough. You may still be hoping for this to happen and that is why it is so upsetting every time you see them and it doesn't happen. It seems like it is never going to happen and you need to find alternative ways to feel more important and f*** them!

I'm not sure all my waffle is of any help as it doesn't address the problem of how to cope with seeing your sisters if any little thing they do triggers how crap they all made you feel during childhood. I've just been writing as my thoughts come to me about trying to understand/imagine your situation.

2309,"*Hmm*' you make a very good point about mistrust of counselling - I think proper support and counselling could make a world of difference in various ways (as I said, I've had a fair bit of counselling for depression, and thank goodness) -

But it's clear birth phobias are not widely understood, attitudes towards  them vary hugely, and if women see counselling as a disguised attempt to force them into an unwanted VB, then it's just not going to work. 

The NICE guidelines do imply that a maternal request CS is something to be 'counselled away', to some degree. Woman asks for CS - is offered counselling - if after counselling she STILL wants one, she should have one.... Structurally it seems more like a hoop you have to jumo through to get a CS. And I know HCPs don't have to pay attention to NICE guidelines anyway. 

 FWIW, the psychiatric support I had when I was pregnant, once the CS had been agreed (around 20 something weeks) was very good - it just consisted of making sure I had someone I could talk to if I got very anxious, and talking about my triggers (the ones I knew about, anyway) meant they could advise staff and try and organise my care accordingly. I also got a very courteous follow-up appt to check for PND, which I didn't get, but it was nice of them to ask! So perinatal mental health support doesn't have to be just about trying to persuade women to have VBs....",2012-05-20 21:52:43+00:00,1476972,Anyone knows what &quot;anxiety management &quot; entails for Tokophobia etc,childbirth

Neither my parents nor DH's parents really ""need"" any extra money, but my grandmother is running out of funds for her nursing home fees (outlived her own expectations!) and my Dad and his siblings (all retired) are having to subsidise it. It's very expensive, so helping with that  would also be a priority. And DMIL has dementia, so I would like to help fund some care or cleaning. To be honest, all that probably adds up to quite a lot. If I could afford not to work and to do voluntary work instead then I would. And I would give some to the charities we already support. If it meant we had extra disposable income generally, then I would probably spend more on travel. Or solar panels for the roof to generate our own electricity.

To be fair, as the above poster, you’ll be exhausted, recovering from labour & working out how to look after your newborn. It’s quite nice to have nowhere to rush off too, not having to keep your house mega clean for visitors etc! And to just rest & enjoy your baby. 🥰 Sadly, my newborn is my second child & I also have a hyper toddler to look after. So no rest for me. In fact, a lot less time with new baby than I’d hoped as DD1 would normally be at nursery! 😫

You will still see a midwife 2 or 3 times after discharge from hospital & then I had the choice of the HV coming out to see me around 3 weeks or I could just chat on the phone. Being my second child, I opted for the phone call. They won’t abandon you, there is still so much support out there. It’s just not always face to face. But they won’t take any chances with a newborn. If they need to see them for whatever reason, they will. My midwives & the HV have been great.. my baby has tongue tie but nowhere is performing the procedure to cut it at the mo, so they’ve been helping me with feeding & the problems we’ve been having!

Bristol zoo is good, nice grounds and ramped access to all animal enclosures but some of the doors to open into enclosures are a little heavy so if your muscle strength you may need to consider taking a mate but a mate gets in free so not hard to persuade a friend to go usually!

[quote namechangeforfriday]I know I’m a minority here but I think it’s completely unreasonable for landlords to blanket disallow pets - it should be on a case by case basis. The PP is right that you don’t own their lives. I’d never become a landlord but if I was, I would allow pets. It’s even more ridiculous that even flat owners can have clauses in the lease that don’t allow pets. It’s no one else’s business what people do in homes that they’re paying to live in. Children are often as noisy, messy and annoying as dogs but you can’t ban people from having them.[/quote]
*@namechangeforfriday* maybe if you were a landlord you’d understand! In an ideal world of course it would be fine, everyone can have pets and there would be not problems. 

Unfortunately when you get new tenants you have no idea what kind of people they will be, some might be the most respectful, honest, and clean people who would look after a pet well, never cause any damage etc. Others destroy things, don’t give a shit about keeping things nicely, let dog/cat piss all over floors and ruin carpets, ruin furniture. And sometimes even if you were to take the money for damages from the deposit it wouldn’t be enough to cover it. Especially now there are limits to the amount of deposit.

2509,"Thats brilliant UC, you seem to be heading in the right direction. I totally agree that intimacy can be rebuilt. I ^never^ thought in a million years that I would feel anything for DP after all that happened between us, I felt really closed to him in that area, I just wan't interested but, he has invested a lot of himself, not to win me round as such, he hasn't set out to get me into bed but he has set out to make me love him again. The thing is it's the daft little things that have made me go funny in the tummy and want to be close to him, like little looks that we now share and little jokes. It's hard to explain really but I do believe this has all come about from going right back to basics, being friends first, respecting each other, no pressures or expectations, just a nice easy friendly relationship. I can honestly say I have no expectations of him or the relationship at all now and I love it, it's each moment, each day as it comes. I am happy enough within myself that I don't expect him to ^make^ me feel loved or special BUT, it is happening anyway, he is telling me he loves me, he is hugging me just because he feels like it, kissing me too. All from a man who I thought was emotionally closed. 

I have digressed sorry I suppose what I am trying to say UC is take care of yourself, your own needs, be happy for ^you^, this will bring about a change in you which he is sure to fnid attractive, he won't want any other man to benefit from the changes anyway, thats for sure! 

I do believe that if he wasn't still interested in you he wouldn't be talking to you. I think he is maybe trying to sort his own head out and I agree with you, I don;t for one minute think he can be in love so quickly. He may be in love with the idea, the fantasy but real love is something that develops, it's somethng that gets deeper and grows stronger after all the time and work that is invested, after things such as an affair etc. I don't believe love is all about sex and all that slushy stuff either, it's about being happy with each other, independently of each other, happy with silences sometimes, knowing that you are communicating in a way other than talking, it's about acknowledging that although he may not always tell you he loves he, he shows you he loves you by his actions, it's being open to everything, not just words. Crikey I've digressed again and I'm still not sure I've got across what I mean 

If you want him back UC then give it your best shot. If you love him unconditionally then fight for him, but don't so it verbally, don't do it in a needy way, ^show^ ^him^. Love yourself first and give him the space to come to you. 

Myabe UC he is worried that if he does come back to you things are going to be the same as they were. Could that be a possibility? Maybe he just feels there is no point in coming back for more of the same, that if things don't change he still won't be happy. It's just a thought so I hope it hasn't offended you. I'm analysing and trying to see it from different perspectives. If that ^is6 the case then he needs to feel he can trust you, he needs to feel comfortable aroud you first, relaxed, not under pressure to come back. Once he feels comfortable then he may be even more open or you may find he makes the next move Thats what we are aiming for! Him to do the work!!

OK, I had better stop waffling. 

But so far so good UC. Keep up the good work! xx

OP, unfortunately this is your fault.  You didn't invest enough time in finding out exactly what your customer wanted and it is your customer service which is at fault here.  I think the fact that you didn't bake her one test cake to agree the design is a glaring fault for a start. Or at least give her a sketch of what you expected the cake to look like.

I think the only answer is to give her a refund and review your procedures so it doesn't happen again.  View it as a learning experience and an investment which will help you understand exactly what your customers want in the future.

I know people are telling you to stick her and that she's trying it on.  But I think these are probably people who understand very little about business and how to treat customers.

2554,"Can't believe I'm posting on here ^again^ but I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this. 

For the past week or so (and it was already slowing before that) ds has only fed about 3 times during the day. So I think today after an early-hours feed which I still would count as a night feed (we co-sleep so not exactly sure when it was) I think he fed at about 9.30am, 1pm and 4.30pm and then his bedtime feed just now at about 7ish. All fairly short feeds but then he's always been quite a fast feeder.

 He is a big boy and has always put on weight well and we have been BLW for a few weeks now. Although he really enjoys food and seems to know exactly what to do with it, I can't imagine he is getting that much in yet from a food point of view. 

He still is feeding --quite-- a lot at night, has actually been waking for 2 supposed dream feeds and then maybe 2 or 3 feeds in the main body of the night. 

He never wants to feed when he first wakes up and I *can not* get him to feed more in the day if he doesn't want to but feeding has never been such a comfort thing for him, more a necessity (many previous posts have explained!) and he often much prefers his dummy.

Anyway, I have just been getting a bit worried about his hydration during the day as his nappies really aren't very wet, although his overnight nappy is usually very heavy.

I have posted before about how to get him to feed more during the day to reduce the night time feeds but I just don't know how it's ever going to happen if he will barely feed enough to stay hydrated in the day and just refuses all other offers, getting really quite cross about it.

Anyway this has turned into one of those silly posts where there is no real question being asked so apologies...it just feels so strange that he hardly feeds at all and just wondered if anyone else had a similar experience.",2012-07-08 19:46:42+00:00,1513102,6 mo bf baby hardly feeds in day,breast_and_bottle_feeding

 If you had been sucessful in breast feeding your dd, you would also have experienced the disadvantages which breast feeding brings with it.

 A vast number of women do not manage to deliver vaginally and/or to breast feed their babies but are definitely fantastic mothers. The very existence of your dd is massive and undeniable proof of both your womanhood and motherhood. 
 Every mother tries to be a perfect parent and no mother ever is because its not possible...Being a ""good enough"" parent is the closest any of us will ever get.

Can make you feel like, actually, the people you thought were friends, actually weren't.  And that's quite sad.  I have a friend who last year adopted an eight-year old with her partner.  I had a text on my birthday and a very brief text when my beloved Nan died (and this friend knew how close we were).  This is someone for whom I was always there in every crisis, with every bloke, with every family row, when she was ill.

2620,"Hi,

I've been having a few problems feeding my 10 week old DS over the past couple of weeks, and wanted some advice. About 2 weeks ago, I had what I thought was a blocked duct - fed DS lots and lots on that side, warm compresses, massage etc, and it didn't seem to clear, and I also had a wee white blister on the end of my nipple. Finally, after waking DS up to feed at 3am (he's sleeping through from 10pm-7am pretty regularly), had a boob like a rock and a very distended milk duct visible on the surface. Didn't clear and eventually (was in a lot of pain), sterilised a needle and popped the blister-thing. DS fed, duct cleared, problem over...right?

Since a day or so after that have been experiencing agonising pain in that breast - when he latches on and for the first few minutes of a feed, but really sharp pain after the feed as well. Nipple is v sensitive - anything touching it is pretty painful. This went on for about 10 days, seemed to clear up and then this morning was right back at the beginning, only without any engorgement, just toe-curling pain!

Have noticed white patches on DS tongue, but he's asleep right now, so can't check if they are there all the time (assumed it was just milk clots when I saw them).

So where do I go from here? Is it worth going to the doctor? SHould I go armed with leaflets? Or should I just go to the pharmacy?

One reason they might not look great is the fit.  Could you take up the hem?  Put darts in to make more fitted?

It's a size 10, bought in the sale because they didn't have a 12.  Now I'm slimmer it looks nice and I've worn it several times already this spring.  So, would it fit better if you lost weight?

Another reason might be colour.  Who was it upthread who had fun dying things?  Take a leaf from their book!

Another reason might be style.  Some styles are just going to look dated.  You have to make a decision whether you're going to hang onto it until it comes back into fashion, or not.

I received a standard reply from the lot of them.  One of the mentioned items that I spotted in their letter was that buildings are erected too close to waterways to enable dredging machinery (JCB type things) to travel along the sides of the rivers to dredge and build up levees with the silt.  

I know what I'm talking about because we used to have a house, built in 1964, with the back garden leading down to a brook and the farmer who had the land opposite used to come round annually with his JCB to dredge and levee.  We did have the odd overflow at the bottom of the long garden but nothing like we see these days.

I've even written to my current local council about a 3-4 foot deep brook alongside the A4 where plants have been allowed to grow and fill it and trees now live there.  If vegetation is not eliminated from these waterways, there is no room for the rainwater to flow along.

Granted, it's the responsibility of landowners to dredge their own property but it should be more frequent especially with buildings on flood plains.  

I attended an exhibition of a proposed large development on a flood plain here (Kennet) and asked a demonstrator where the water table would be displaced to if foundations etc were built to its depth (in the planning application).  I received a non-committal <she's an old fool, I'll gve her some nonsense talk> reply but I stood there and asked the question three times --with a crowd drawing around with interest-- and he finally said that the displaced water table would go into the nearest town centre because the Kennet would not be able to cope.  The planning application never got anywhere and the land is now a SSSI.

Remember the news about the recent floods in Bangkok.  I had a postcard sent to me in 1970 something which described how canals there had been filled in to allow building work to take place.  I sent copies to my MP etc and they took no notice.

Did anyone read to the end of this?  Sorry.  Sometimes, I can't stop writing once I start.",2012-07-06 15:34:19+00:00,1511580,about rain reporting?,am_i_being_unreasonable

2726,"If your account is private, both Facebook and Instagram ( and completely private with no posts viewable and closed friends list, and minimal biography information) there is nothing wrong with sharing the back to school shots.
BUT.
When a parent has a public Facebook or Instagram and posts an image of a back to school shot, location tagged, with the school name, and a picture of their child - they not only often name the child in full, but their own accounts are open- so further details about the family and the child are revealed. 
The days of a newspaper safely publishing first day kids should be gone, because a child's full name may be cross referenced with parent surnames if a school has a Facebook or Instagram account, and said parents interact with it.

Aside from the risk of online grooming (additionally, a surprising number of parents also link to children's social media if they are slightly older) the data provided within these public accounts  often contains enough information to construct a false identity. 
You can gain a child's DOB, full name, parents names, jobs, educational institutions, and DOBs, and often street addresses, plus where a child was born. By the time a child reaches the age where they wish to gain bank accounts of their own, and ID documents - they can find their identity has been stolen.

Secondly, what these families with no account privacy also hand out  are enough details about the family for a stranger to convince a child they are indeed a family friend. Name of the pets, family nicknames, where the child has been on holiday, mum's best friends, all the relatives names, what the child did for their most recent birthday and the names of their siblings. Enough to convince a child that this person does indeed know their family.  

Finally, little kids in uniform, and little kids at dance classes posted on a proud parents public Instagram account are paedophile fodder. They aren't going to be leaping the fence of your home, but they will collect the images of children they find attractive, and add them to their libraries which are shared amongst others of their ilk. Open parent accounts then provide many more image of said cute child and thus many more images are copied and fielded around the world to be found by police when searching for missing and trafficked children amongst these copied images from Instagram and Facebook. Even the idea of an image of my child being a mastubatory tool for creeps worldwide is enough for me to never post anything about my kids, even if I do have very private social media. ( Back to school shots are a doorway to locating that cute kid initially, as is searching school location tags).

Personally I think, spamming your child across the world via social media shows no respect for their privacy, and their future digital footprint. There are risks involved.  Not securing your Facebook account, or your Instagram is incredibly silly and irresponsible if you wish to share images of your kids.

But I don't from that, conclude that all xp's are like that - I know that my children have been unlucky, they're some of the minority whose fathers have some kind of difficulty in functioning as fathers. But I believe that the majority of separated parents do their best to put the interests of the children first, and I strongly believe that for those who don't, the law should not be changed to the disadvantage of the majority, just because of the mad behaviour of a minority, be they men or women. And the problem with f4j, is that the world revolves around them and the law of the country should be changed just for them. It's a starting point which I believe is infantile.

77.	*The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat – Oliver Sachs*.  In this book Sachs presents a selection of case stories about some of his neurological patients and their diagnoses.  The people in the pages of this book were drawn beautifully and their stories told with compassion, empathy and understanding.  

78.	*The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet – David Mitchell*. I read this during the summer but somehow forgot to add it to my list.  Set on the trading island of Dejima, Japan in the18th century this book follows the lives Dutch trader Jacob de Zoet and his colleagues and their interactions with the Japanese shoguns and other officials.  This was a bit of a slow burner for me and I read it in starts and stops.  I enjoy good historical fiction and this one definitely hit the spot once I got into my stride. 

79.	*Burial Rites – Hannah Kent*.  Another 19th century historical novel. This story is based on Agnes Magnúsdóttir, who was the last person to be executed in Iceland.   Beautiful and bleak.

 You said you would be interested in the feelings of those who work full time and their views on their relationship with their children. 
 
 Here are mine, although I guess one person does not make a representative sample. 
 
 My DS (now 9 months) was not quite planned but welcome. I had some severe problems adjusting to his presence in my life for the first two months (looking back on it, probably mild PND) so I got a part-time helper to lift the burden from me a little and give me some space. This was a great success and has probably given me the confidence that DS enjoys being cared for by others. 
 
 Since then, he went to nursury (at 4 months old) and I work full time. For the record, I probably don't have to, although giving it up would mean large sacrifices. 
 
 I do not feel, in any way, remote or usurped from him. He responds well to several carers which in my view is a positive thing but he knows his mum and dad and obviously loves us (when we're not changing his nappy ). 
 
 I do sometimes regret what I have sacrificed to have him (don't we all) but I can say categorically that he is not a mistake that I am trying to undo. 
 
 My decision to work is to me so uncontroversial that I don't generally discuss it. I'm not cut out to be a full time mum (don't know how you do it) and I know that with the same strength of feeling that many mums know they could not bear to part with their babies. 
 
 So there it goes - strange but true - some working mothers do it because they're happy and their babies are happy.

 My son who will be 3 on new years day has GDD and also hypotonia. We have been through all the assesments and are still awaiting more tests including MRI and skin biopsy. 
 He cannot walk with out aid and can only manage 6 steps, he also cannot speak, apart from the word ""NO"", but he is happy and content, and although he struggles to communicate he underdtands ""EVERYTHING"". 
 He received his statement in july and has been attending the local special schools nursery 5 afternoons a week, and all i can say is what an improvement and how much fun for him socialising with others around his age and with similar and worse problems. 
 It is hard as a mum, i know, i sometimes think what are they saying/doing about my son, but at the end of the day, i see the happy little boy with so much enthusiasm and acheivement that i forget the rest of the shitty things like you say, filling the DLA forms is hard as you realise just how different they are from others of their age, but it gets you extra financial support to benefit you and your family. 
 I hope that you start to see the brighter side of things and just to let you know that you are not alone, the statements, dla,ca are all there to help both finacially and supportively for your childs needs.

One option could be to do the selection by banding currently used by academies - an entrance exam is taken, and the children put into banded groups, and a number are taken from each band.

2868,"Hi OP - it looks very much like your dog is some kind of beagle or hound-type cross, is that right?

If so, they can have very, very high prey drives (I own a beagle) and it can prove very difficult to control that. Sometimes it's better to manage the environment than to try and train out years of breeding. Hounds were bred to run independently away from their handlers, too, so you do need to treat them a little differently than you would, say, a Labrador or a spaniel.

With the chickens, I genuinely think your best bet would be to just block all her access to them as Polly said. Once you've blocked the visual stimulus, you can work on desensitising her to the sounds and smells of them, but be warned that you may not ever manage to stop it completely. Hounds are hunters and will kill their prey. Mine has disappeared off and re-emerged with a dead rabbit in his mouth before now!

I would also say to up the exercise a little - an hour is not much for a hound-breed. If you can't manage it yourself due to work commitments, I would see if you can get a dog-walker to come in and give her a good walk at some point in the day. Maybe mid morning would work well, then you could take her for another hour later in the day.

But honestly, you are NOT a bad dog owner. Hounds can be very challenging as they weren't bred to work alongside people, they were bred to go off and do their own thing, then when they found their ""quarry"", they'd bay and the human hunters would come running [wink]

This has been proven in studies but ime it looks like this: Obv there are factors like peer pressure etc. However, by the time they're in Y10 and 11, a lot of them have matured even in the worst comp and they realise GCSEs are real. A chunk will stop turning up. Schools won't want to off roll them before Oct/Jan census otherwise they won't get money for them. This is often why you sometimes see the message that this data represents 224 out of 249 pupils. The ones from 'good' homes with parents that will help them with revision timetables, warm meals, grade incentives, tutors etc etc will be the ones that always make it. 
In my opinion this is why the 'naise' area schools have such high progress made. Those parents are there and they are not working nights, they speak English, they have a quiet space, their kids are told GCSEs are important not just by the cringey head teacher but by their parents. Their parents can laugh with them about how hard o levels were and they have common ground. All of this is a huge huge thing and almost impossible for a school to replicate.

2924,"Our house has a solid wood kitchen that was put in in the 1980s but has had two facelifts since (ha I make it sound like Joan Collins there...)

The carcasses and doors are all in perfectly good condition and we like the layout. It's not the super fashionable in-frame kitchen so will still look a bit dated though whatever we do. 

I did get quotes for a new in-frame solid wood one and we were going to go ahead but then realised that maybe at some stage we might move and is it really worth it etc. 

At the moment it is painted white (done about 8 years ago), has white Corian worksurfaces (maybe 12 years old) that could do with a re-sand as they are marked/ scratched a bit. 
Floor is Amtico oak with too narrow panels but I can live with it. It's only about six years old. 

The plan I have for a facelift would be as follows:

- sand and paint cupboards with nice soothing F&B type colour
- replace hideously tatty tiles with nice new Fired Earth type ones (not actually FE)
- replace door handles with smaller, more fashionable ones
- keep floor and worksurfaces as is but maybe get the Corian resanded.
- Change the oven (it's one of those horrid old white ones and will surely die soon as it's 25 years old! Can't be very energy efficient either)
- change tap
- new oven to be fitted
-change yucky too wide spotlights for smaller ones and get pendant shades over kitchen table
- change kitchen door/ boiler room door. 


Other downsides of just facelifting not replacing:
- as above it's not in frame
- it has a couple of quite twee features, like curvy little shelves under the upper cupboards. These are actually useful though!

I was particularly reassured by the fact that the judge had refused forced entry previously and was very aware of the increasing levels of distress.

I know that isn't a perfectly logical reason for trusting the judge, as that means a judge looks less reliable if the social services are making really good decisions all the time... But in the light of lack of transparency and trust in social services or individuals in the judiary service, it's qualitative evidence that that judge is using their position to put in place all the checks and balances that ensure correct decision making.

2972,"I am an introvert - this is not the same as being anxious or socially awkward, it doesn't necessarily mean ""shy"" or ""hates people"" it just means that I get energy from being by myself and I find large groups of people quite draining. I can be loud and bubbly in a group and people don't always think of me as an introvert. I enjoy being with people but it exhausts me! So I regularly need time away from people to recharge.

However I also have anxiety disorder and depression so my views of the world are slightly skewed. I constantly worry about something I have said or how I have come across to people - I have organised a night out for friends next month and I am so worried about it, I can't sleep and keep having dreams where it all goes wrong. I am convinced they are all talking about me behind my back about the rubbish thing I have organised. But I wouldn't react in the same way as I fear others react to me. If someone organised a night for me I would be grateful and enjoy it whatever. But I still find it hard to believe that others feel that way about me. DH is forever saying to me ""but if it were the other way round, would you say that / think like that ?"" And of course the answer is no. 

But I don't think being an introvert has anything to do with any of that. Introvert doesn't mean anxious. Anxiety means anxious. They don't necessarily go hand in hand. And anxiety is not rational! So just because I think ""oh no, I said X so she is going to think I am an idiot"" doesn't mean if she said ""X"" to me that I would think she is an idiot IYSWIM.

The big recent positive changes for me are 1) spending less time online (=less temptations, less comparing, more time used pursuing more satisfying things) and 2) spending less time in or near my bed. I used to feel exhausted after a long workday and responsing to the incessant needs of DC: instead of doing something active, I just sprawled on the bed, either reading, browsing magazines or websurfing. Not great for my morale or for getting things done.

Now, instead of lying down, I sit in the roof garden (infinitely more relaxing, and the children like to play there) or potter about in the kitchen listening to classical music, cooking or baking (old hobbies revived) or go out and exercise. Or sit in my Egg armchair reading. When the summer is over, I'll need to move the armchair to the nicest spot in the house - the garden has become my safe haven and I need to have a similar spot of peace and calm in the winter too. 

Keeping a journal is really helpful too. Over the years, I've became the receptacle for everyone's frustrations. DH tells me at lunch about what's wrong with his day --and Italy--, Nanny shows me broken toys and appliances and food that's rotting in the fridge and everything else that needs fixing; DC are tired and take it out on me in the morning and in the evening. I don't see my friends and relatives often enough to have a natural outlet - for too long, I've felt like the container of all negativity around me. 

Neutralizing negative emotions is not easy, but three things seem to really help: 1) keeping a journal (writing things down puts them in perspective), 2) practising mindfulness, focusing on the present moment, and 3) acting out (using the negative energy for something constructive, like clearouts, decluttering, organizing, exercising).

*Bill* I find the clinking of coins of the Toshl app a very good thing [grin] - credit cards are silent and deadly [wink] and money becomes too abstract. I find this increases my mindfulness while shopping for everyday things. For the first time in years, I budgeted all monthly household and personal expenses and my contibutions to my savings accounts - it's interesting to see where the money really goes.

I've done quite a lot of reading, exploring and getting to know myself. Shopping was all about 'filling the void' for me and right now I'm exploring the void. I find this is a period of psychological/spiritual change and growth. I don't want to become even more self-absorbed - rather, I'm exploring both my dysfunctional traits and my strengths to understand where the areas of friction are. If anyone needs reading tips, please let me know!

A question for anyone but to do with reflux.   DGS has put on weight and shot up in height (which he always does with a few extra calories).   We thought we had cracked it as getting 120 mls fortini at a time with no vomiting, but lately putting it down the tube he is puking most of it up, either immediately or 10 minutes later.  He's not ill but if he's laying down its as if the fluid just comes straight back into his mouth really easily.  Obviously we feed him in a sitting position, but still vomits easily?  He's never officially had reflux and is not distressed with acid.  His dad and grandad both suffer with reflux and are on meds for life so it might be nothing to do with CP but he is weak in his trunk.  He's always been a major pukey kid.  Would ranitidine stop vomiting?  Maybe an anti sickness drug?  I suppose it needs finding out why but would not be keen on a fundo.  We thought stretching his stomach slowly would stop this but it seemed to be working but not now.  Sick of multiple clothes changes!

Of couse, not all autistic people will have identical views on this, but speaking for himself, it was a definite yes, discuss before first appointment. He said discussing at least twice was good. We discussed in terms of different people's brains work differently. Some brains have certain strengths and weaknesses  or properties, that are useful to know about to help us with everyday life, e.g. being really good at concentrating on something you love, taking things literally, sensory differences. It did help that we knew as family friends at that stage several other autistic children and adults, so it was clear that it was no bar to friendship. It's good to know that autistic people exist even if there is no diagnosis in the end. 
Telling  him the diagnosis as soon as known was a definite yes, and he said he would have felt angry and let down if we had not shared tbis immediately.

It is really not possible to have any sort of a relationship with a narcissist and you at all writing to them and forwarding them emails just allows them to further hurt you again.

3026,"I very nearly had mine PTS. She nipped somebody as they went to stroke her. I was mortified and furious all at once.

I saw a behaviouralist and had her assessed. Turns out she was screaming out signals none of which Iistened too. The trainer only agreed to work with her on certain conditions and I would be wary of anyone who tells you he can be fixed. He can't, it's about management and improvement but he won't be a normal dog ever. You can never trust him again despite how much he improves. 

However, I think it is massively important when working with a dog that you are not scared of it and that it respects you. You can't work with a dog you are scared of, I don't see how it would be possible as dogs know if your not confident and feed from it.  You need to be able to confidently handle him, muzzle him etc otherwise it's a dangerous situation. If he is growling at you when muzzling him etc that's a massive red flag for me, I could literally do anything to my dog and she would never so much as grumble. If you can't control him enough to muzzle him without him kicking off you can't train him.

The first thing I did was take steps to ensure she could never hurt anyone again. We created somewhere for her to go when people visit so she is safely secure, she is never out of the house unmuzzled or off lead unless it's secure, she wears a warning vest, we work with her in weekly behaviour sessions. She is much better but you need to take it really seriously, you know what he is capable of so slipping the muzzle off for 10mins or letting someone stroke him because he hasn't bitten before isn't really acceptable, you need to be all or nothing for the rest of his life. Nobody but family touches my dog now, not worth the risk even though she is 'rehabilitated' 

On a final note I actually met one of the top ridegeback champion stud dogs a few years back and that was the most unpredictable and scary dog I handled in a long time. One second he was lovely and the next he was going for you full force [hmm] still the breeder laughed it off!

By the time I got home from work it was soggy again and the skin closures had come off.

Fast forward to Friday. I was at minor injuries for something unrelated and asked the nurse to have a look. She said it looked fine, but gave it a bit of wound glue and a new dressing to make sure it closed properly.

That stayed on until yesterday evening when I noticed the dressing was soggy, again. When I peeled it off the glue had completely come away and it's still weeping clear stuff.

It's pretty much closed together, not sore, not red and doesn't smell, so why is it still weeping so much? The top of my sock is as wet as it would be after a spin cycle in the washing machine, as is the bottom of my leggings on that side.

The lingo and social media etc and they are now close  ""friends"" but clearly it's been a friendship based on my friend buying her stuff. 

My friend struggles a bit with spelling and grammar and doesn't really seem able to take it much further. Since she's been swallowed any contact with me has included the damn arbonne stuff. 

I tried to discuss it with her in a flippant way; friends have been mistaken by mlms. It's unethical etc. She is adamant it's a wonderful thing. I've since learnt this mlm is favoured by gps etc; she's a nurse. 

My query is that she's posted this and I wondered how ""kosher"" it is; as at the moment my only point she's been unable to challenge is ethics from the POV of pyramid selling.

Waiter was impatient and distracted and not looking at/listening to us while we ordered. My friend's a vegetarian so she had to ask what her dishes were cooked in, which, with some language difficulties thrown in, led to increasing frustration on both sides. She ordered extra potatoes which made things worse. Turns out the chicken with ham and cheese came with potatoes, so I said no potatoes - he thought I also wanted more potatoes so I had to say again 'no potatoes!' at which point he rolled his eyes at me! I then asked for spinach with butter instead. Meal came with no potatoes but no spinach - when I said to a waitress I'd ordered it, he shouted across the restaurant 'no she didn't, she said no potatoes!' We were giggling by this point...

Then ordered a dish described on menu as 'strawberries and fresh whipped cream with mint leaves'. When it came, the cream was clearly some kind of product with lots of sugar in, and the whole thing was covered in icing sugar. Felt I'd made a fuss by this point so ate strawberries and half of cream! Annoyed as I've had a really good LC run and a good loss already this week.

3139,"*You do not need to change your name by deed poll*

Once you marry, all that actually does is give you the option to use HIS surname as your name, if you choose. You still 'have' your original surname. It's still your surname as much as it ever was. You retain it. Plenty of people use both throughout their marriage, for example using their original surname at work, their 'married' name in personal life. You ^gain^ the right to use his when you marry, but you don't actually ^lose^ your old one. 

It is confusing because as other posters have said, you might find yourself needing legal docs to make some changes - but this won't be because you need to 'reclaim' that surname, it will simply be because you've eg got a passport in your married name, or a bank account and you want to change it. It's not about needing to 'reclaim' or 're-register' YOURSELF with your old surname.

The only thing which takes AWAY an old surname and replaces it is if you ^do^ complete a deed poll- that's a change. Marrying isn't, it just gives you a 'courtesy' use of ^second^ potential surname. 

So you really shouldn't deed poll change- that's just more confusion.

You can just start using your original surname right now and start changing bank stuff and passport etc. Quite straightforward.

And yes you can call your baby your surname at any point and you absolutely should!

As for the birth cert, personally I would leave him off, as although if you're still married when the birth takes place he will automatically have parental responsibility, I would let HIM make the running to go on the certificate as it will tell you a lot about how serious he might be about remaining in your daughter's life - and that might be useful information for you.

And you can claim maintenance without him being on a birth cert. 

I'm sorry, horrible for you - but if it were me, I'd be so glad to know all this before the lying little shit ended up being my birth partner! 

By the way, don't tell him when the baby is born until she is registered - because as you are married, he has the right to do that. Register the baby yourself in hospital straight away, with the names you choose then tell him.

Do what you need to do to strengthen your partnership with DH because you really will need each other to get through the teen years with some kids.

On the attached plan of our house, it shows a hedge. Elsewhere on the boundary line there are the little Ts to denote ownership of the boundary, which are fences. But there is no T on the hedge itself, even though there is a bold line to show the hedge is inside the boundary. 

Do we own the hedge or not? I say we don't, because the hedge was there before the house was built. DH says we own it as it's within the line and the hedge would have been planted when the planning permission was given (years and years ago). 

No one currently lives in the house the other side of the hedge so we can't have a conversation.

Good luck for all you clomid ladies. Welcome to the thread *marie* and so sorry about your mc. You've definitely come to the right thread for support.

Thanks for all the information and support over the past 2 days. I managed to get some sleep last night so that's good. I had my acupuncture apt this morning and I've got a counselling apt this evening and I'm spending the day laid on the sofa watching The White Queen and trying to resist the temptation to google. I've also just got off the phone from one of the consultants team. Basically he can't make any prognosis or decisions on one result and as *coconut* rightly said they need to be repeated in a couple of months time which means more waiting. I do understand but just feel in limbo at the moment. In the meantime I need to do everything in my power to try and reduce my stress levels and hopefully my fsh level, however, the thought of trying to reduce my stress levels is stressing me out!!! What a vicious circle! No, I'm going to try and focus on eating healthy, exercising and trying to chill to hell out!  *coconut* did you ever get any advice on what you should/shouldn't be eating and how much exercise you should be getting?

3234,"My MIL doesn't like me. From the start, I got the feeling she saw me as young and dumb... not good enough for her golden child. 

I feel resent from her for taking her son from her. He lived at home until he was 26 and was very close to her until we had our son and family life took over. 
She is used to having my husband at her beck and call and now I am with him she's not his priority anymore. 

She has her own partner and she's close with his family. I have often caught her and her partner making comments about me and my family. They look down on us and think they are better than us. 

There have been a few instances where she hasn't been very nice to me or my husband. 

When we first had our son we lived with my mum. She would try to call round to see our son after work, without calling first to check if it was okay. This annoyed me as firstly it wasn't our house it was my mum's and it was unfair on my mum. Plus it was usually when my husband had only just got home after work or when we were trying to get our son down for the night. 

There were other times two, one that really sticks in my mind is on my birthday. It was about 8 pm and we had just put our son down for the night. And was just about to enjoy our dinner, when she knocked on the door, the dogs started barking and woke him up. 

We had told her time and time again to call before coming round, as people coming to the door makes the dogs bark, and if our son is sleeping it wakes him up. 

Also, we don't always like to have visitors past our son's tea time as we start his bedtime routine and it unsettles him. 
Plus the fact that it was my birthday and it was being made about her... when all I wanted was a cosy night in with my husband. I was already in my pj's and felt embarrassed. 

My husband was peed off when he answered the door and told her she should have asked first, she didn't apologise for waking our son up and just said 'does it look like I care'.

I put on my best 'nice to see you smile' and tried to make light of the situation, and offered her a cup of tea. She got to see our son and three hours later she left. I then privately messaged her the next day thanking her for the gifts and apologised on behalf of my husband for his rudeness.

It read; "" Hi, Thank you for my birthday flowers and card, they are beautiful. Sorry *Was a bit grumpy opening the door last night, he was just a bit annoyed that you had disturbed *'s bedtime routine and we prefer for people to call to see if it's okay to come round beforehand. Thanks again and see you soon x""

My MIL didn't reply to me, we didn't hear from her for a few weeks so my husband messaged her and asked if she was okay, and if she has fallen out with us. She then messaged my husband privately with a bit of an odd message. 

It read; ""Hi no I haven't fallen out with you but I must say this, I have been very hurt and disappointed by you. I agree getting *in a routine is important and PEOPLE should ring but I am not just PEOPLE. I am your mum and *'s nana! I want to see you for dinner because I don't want this to become an issue. Still, love you. 

she then just met up with my husband (not me) for dinner and they didn't talk about things, she just brushed it under the carpet. 

Another thing is the fact that I haven't let our son sleepover at hers yet, I haven't as I know she likes a drink. Which a drink I am fine with, however, She usually has a bottle of wine if not more every evening. She has been referred by her doctor to an alcohol group and I was under the impression she wasn't supposed to be drinking as she has other health issues which alcohol can make worse. 
Yet my sister spotted her buying bottles of wine from the shop and she's always out drinking and posting it all over Facebook. 

The second reason I have let him stay at hers is that she had two dogs that she lets rule the house, they pee and poo inside... sleep in her bed and bark constantly. She lets them jump up and lick him and I just can't stand it. We have dogs and I keep them in the kitchen, we have baby gates as they aren't allowed where he plays or upstairs where we sleep. 

My mum met up with my MIL the other day and they got talking about my husband and I. My mum said how lovely it is to see us both together and how alike we are. All positive things.

My mum also said that my husband is so laid back which is good as I need someone like that due to what I have been through. 
My MIL then replied with an odd comment: 'Yeah well there's only so much he can take' and continues with 'he left previous relationships as they weren't equal' and suggested that my husband was only with me due to our son. 

This really got to me as if she is saying things like this to my own mum, what is she saying to other people? 

My MIL had also arranged her Birthday party this year for my Birthday weekend (24th February). 
The same day that my nephews 1st birthday is on, my grandmas birthday weekend is on and it's also the weekend after Valentine's Day. Her birthday isn't until 17th March.... 

I just feel like she does things like this to get at me as now we have to choose between my family or her. It's like she wants to cause tension and for her partners family to feel sorry for her when me and my husband aren't at her party as we have other plans. 

When I tell her our son is poorly or I am poorly she ignores the message and just writes back about herself, she acts like she doesn't know how to use Facebook but comments on my husband's brothers pictures of his daughter (her granddaughter) but not Freddie. 

I just don't know what to do anymore, she currently has him every Wednesday 8.30am -4pm and still doesn't seem happy with that... 

I'm so happy she wants to see our son, but its always on her terms. When we go to party's together (our wedding etc) she isn't bothered about him... she is more interested in getting drunk and doesn't help out. 

She makes me feel so crap about myself with the negative comments It's just not needed. If she didn't like me I would prefer she just said rather than make me out to be the bad person all the time.",2017-12-04 14:29:10+00:00,3104171,MIL Trouble...,larger_families

I don't know whether the Oxbridge colleges or the Russell Group need that culture change. Do they?

I'm pregnant with my 2nd and I did breastfeed and express for the first 6 months but to be honest it was a nightmare. We struggled to bond and her to feed, I'm amazed we did for so long. So I expressed using a hand pump, I expressed loads on both sides and after she'd fed. So I felt like a milking machine. I could get loads ounces and ounces. 
But it meant my supply was great so when I stopped it was agony and took 2 painful weeks to stop. 

Maybe I did it right but I would like options and options please. 

I'm not sure if I plan to breast feed this 2nd one for so long. Due to my daughter having serious allergies and reflux ( still having them now at nearly 4) her prescribed formula made her thrive and a happy healthy baby and I fed her it was horrible ) so although this baby might not have allergies at all I'm thinking formula feeding may be best.

^It showed very clearly that your hypothetical infection immunity does not exist for a proportion of people^

Ok, firstly, infection immunity isn’t the ‘hypothetical’ part. We know it exists. 

We already know that immunity after infection does wane for some people. However several studies have shown that for ^the majority^ of people immunity lasts 9+ Months (some have shown over 10/up to 12). The people in this study were infected 6-14/15 months before reinfection. (Infection March-December 2020, reinfection May/June 2021) The people for whom immunity wanes faster after infection may be the same group for whom vaccine immunity wanes faster and yes, these people may need boosters more regularly.

And no, the study ^does not^ show that vaccine immunity would have been ‘better’ because it ^wasn’t^ comparing duration/effectiveness of vaccination and natural immunity (as stated several times now). 

So no, it hasn’t addressed my hypothetical which is that, ^if^ natural infection results in less reinfection than vaccine breakthroughs then it could (hypothetically!) be a good thing to have a percentage of the population immune after natural infection to provide a level of durable population immunity. However, even if natural infection ^did^ provide ‘better’ immunity, it would still make sense to vaccinate the most vulnerable and people for whom immunity is more likely to wane faster.",2021-08-12 17:08:20+00:00,4316043,Why is not having the vaccine selfish,coronavirus

[quote InsultingTheAlligator]My GP incidentally told me the very rapid weight gain was my imagination by the way. (I was bulimic among other things, whch she knew).[/quote]
I got told this, It really pisses me off with hindsight. I put on half a stone in a month and went to the GP to check why. She said it wasn't a side effect I should just stop porking out! Two years and two stone later she admitted it was now recognised anecdotally as a side effect. I don't know anyone who has taken citalopram who hasn't put on weight. But  I know a few people who took sertraline and it had no weight gain effect at all so it might be worth switching if you need them again.

3324,"Are you planning a major home makeover and are interested in bunk beds for kids? Are your children bored bunk beds for kids? Is a bunk bed with storage right in your future? Let help:

We have rounded-up a few of the best bunk beds for kids that hit the major points, which include options in various sizes from toddler bunk beds for girls to full over twin bunk beds with open storage. A word to the wise: kids can sometimes fall off of bunk beds and injure themselves without realizing it until later. One thing to consider when choosing a bunk bed with storage is whether or not the beds will be used. If a child will be sleeping on their own, especially in a small room, then a bunk bed with open storage is probably a good choice. If your child will be sharing a room with another child, or the room is very large, then a triple bunk bed with open storage may be the best one for them. Even if they will still be sharing the room, the open space will allow easier access to storage.

A popular choice for children is a full bunk bed with storage. This is an excellent choice, especially if your child has a lot of things, such as sports equipment or art supplies, that need to be stored safely. A full bunk bed with storage will save a lot of floor space in your child's room and allow them easy access to the items they need for their rooms. Also, as your children get older and begin to outgrow their cribs, you can sell the full bunk bed with storage and use the money towards a nicer crib.

Another great option for bunk beds for kids are convertible beds. A convertible bunk bed is a bunk bed with a mattress that can be converted into a bed. This is perfect for small rooms, or for kids who like to sleep in their beds, but want the option of being able to go to bed in a different room. This is a great way to save space in your kid's room and make it more attractive to parents.

Older kids also have great options when it comes to bunk beds for kids. The typical twin bunk beds for kids are usually a little bit on the high side. A twin wide bed with a twin bed on top is a great option for older kids who are tall and need to save floor space. If you buy a bunk bed with a loft underneath it, then the bottom bunk can be turned into a toddler bed so that your older kids can still get the most use out of their room. As your kids get older, you can upgrade to twin bunk beds with lofts and convert them into twin beds for your older kids.

Whatever type of bunk bed you decide on, make sure that it will provide a good amount of storage. Most bunk beds for kids have a desk, drawers, and a set of drawers that are built right into the bottom bunk. Make sure that your bed has plenty of storage, so that your kid can easily keep their belongings organized and not look all over the place for something when they're trying to sleep. You should also make sure that the bed has a lot of support, so that it will last a long time without wearing out.",2021-04-22 12:21:54+00:00,4225907,Choosing Bunk Beds For Kids That Are Big Enough,baby_names
3325,Oldiemum- the single vaccines are the same strains as in the MMR. I don't think as many doses were given as they had a very poor uptake rate in most countries- except rubella of course (at the time mumps and measles were not seen as killers). So this is what they mean by not being tested as well. More doses have been given of the MMR. But since they refuse to entertain the idea that it may be causing a problem in suscpetible children I'm not sure its that reassuring. I'm not sure whether actual clinical trials were carried out on the MMR seperately- or whether the safety data was taken from the monovalent and assumed to be the same.,2003-12-17 17:11:21+00:00,15334,Has anybody decided not to vaccinate their child or to only selectively vaccinate them?,general_health

I have to say if I'm a leader on a trip I wouldn't bother to ring parents if we got back early unless it was super early (which seems unlikely for a trip like this) just because of the tediousness  of ringing multiple parents!

How was your scan *score*? Did you have to wait long?

I had my 'OMG are you sure it's not a horse inside you' appointment today, following my growth scan on Friday. MUCH excitement I actually saw my consultant!!! I had the same one eight years ago for the boy child, never clapped eyes on him - but he is real.

Anyway - he confirmed that 'yup, he's a whopper alright', and I now have an actual birth plan. My birth with the boy was a bit of a nightmare as I've said before. Three days of failed induction followed by a section. Now, I have my head around having to have a section again, whatever gets my baby out safe & all that, but it was the three days in hospital just WAITING that completely did me in. So... he has suggested that I wait till 40+12 and then if nothing happens then go straight to the section - no faffing around. I'm delighted. OBVIOUSLY I would rather have a VBAC, but this is the next best option. He also confirmed that planned sections DO have a better recovery rate than emergency ones, so that would be another bonus.

3374,"My Mum is a bit like this too.

She lives quite a long way away and was never going to have any sense of wanting to be nearby to be part of our lives and was certainly never going to be the grandparent offering childcare.

My DC are teens now, but they have never invited them to stay for a weekend or arranged to meet them to do something.  When we speak briefly on the phone, mum will never ask to speak to the DC and rarely asks what they are up to.  She doesn’t have much of a relationship with them, which is a shame.

I think she saw being a Mum as quite hard work and a bit of a chore.  Once I and my siblings were independent, it was a bit of a relief for her.  It’s not to say they haven’t been there at all...we can go to them for advice and they have provided financial help sometimes if it’s been needed early on, but it’s very much that they have their lives where they are and want to leave us alone to have ours.  In usual times, we might see them 4 times a year.  I think some of it came from their own experience of having over-bearing in-laws who expected to spend a lot of time with them and they backed off from us to avoid being similar.

But actually, they are just not that interested too.

There is a huge range out there.  Some extended families live in each other’s pockets and are seeing each other every day or several times a week and talking every day on the phone.  Some grandparents spend more hours with the kids than the parents do, some always have extended family holidays and everything is very very close.  That would be a bit much for me, but I am a bit envious of those with parents who are near enough to come over for a Sunday lunch and afternoon and who do that and also will come and babysit if asked without it being a big deal, and who spend time with their grandchildren.  Distance makes a big difference, but it’s attitude too because I know some people whose parents live on the other side of the world, and the contact and relationship they have with the GP is great.",2021-02-26 13:29:53+00:00,4176989,To feel a bit let down by my Mum?,am_i_being_unreasonable

But due to the damage I have, including some nerve damage (not wanting to scare you!) I wasn't!  So it might still be worth getting it checked.  As much as anything, if you are doing them just fine but still have these problems, then that is valuable information that will help with diagnosis and treatment plans.  I have a cystocele (amongst other horrors) which is where the bladder and urethra collapses down into the front of the vaginal wall.  This is partly due to pelvic floor damage, but also due to damage to the vaginal muscles.  It is most noticeable after I've exercised, when things really collapse inwards.  What might be useful is for you to have a feel internally before you exercise, have a good work out (the more jumping around the better!) and then have a feel afterwards. Your muscle tone may well be good enough to hold everything up enough when you are at rest or just doing normal everyday stuff, but not strong enough to keep things together when you exercise.  Useful info for the GP/consultant.  
Other than the test that *ginger* describes, the 'gold standard' test for bladder dysfunction like this is urodynamics where they do things with tubes and pressure sensors - can't give a better description as I haven't had mine yet.  I have that particular joy next week [grin].

I like a minimalist space and things to be clean too so we’re not complete opposites but I feel it has escalated on his part over the past couple of years and I’m struggling at times. I’ve no doubt lockdown has accentuated this.

He is very open when I do something that he doesn’t consider to be acceptable and will say it quite bluntly and it can be hurtful.
Today I got a new pair of trainers and they didn’t fit so I put them back in the original outer packaging and placed them on the dining table to seal and label later, this was partly due to us having a young daughter and I didn’t want her messing with them. He saw them on the table and was horrified that I would put the box on the dining table. I tried to shrug it off and he went on a rant about how that box has been in the back of a van and on a conveyor and it’s gross that I would put it where we eat. He then said I lacked in logic at times..

I suppose I need some perspective, was this a really disgusting thing to do or is he being overly critical? I’m losing touch with reality and what is actually gross and what he considers to be gross! 

I have many more examples and the one above may not be ideal but is is fresh in my memory and just got to me today.. I’m hoping someone out there might be in a similar situation and can relate?

My sis didn't start until she was about 17 and she's 5ft 10, so maybe she went on growing for longer than most? Certainly, with my older children's peers I've noticed that those who grow tall early on (say at 11-12yo) seem to end up shorter than others whose growth spurts are later on, (around 13-15yo). Not everyone, of course, but just a tendency.

She then told me ""Don't you dare go changing your baby in my bathroom"". Wimp that I am, I walked back to my table without responding. After coffee, I mustered up courage to walk up to her and ask her what that was all about. She said ""Women of your type <I assume she meant I'm not white> come in here, buy a measly cup of coffee and leave their baby's dirty nappies in my bathroom bins"". I told her ""You don't have a minimum cover charge. You could put up a notice on the bathroom saying 'Nappy change facilities not available' "".

I am 33 +2 and my partner and I are expecting our first baby together. He's building us a house to live in but won't be ready until a few months after baby is born, so at the moment I'm still living with my parents and so is he.

When were together were the best of friends, we are so close and I'm really happy. However at the weekend we decided to pick the baby's pram, the one I like is a little more expensive but more practical than the one he wants. So to cut a long story short we began arguing over the pram (petty I know) then last night I told him, I'm the one having to sell my car for the new baby (sports car and need to downgrade for money) baby's taking his second name, he's picked the cot, won't let me have the baby name I love, he's chose where to live and then I said to him and your the reason I am not going to have my mum as a birth partner because even though I want her there he feels uncomfortable about it. So I've been absolutely fine over it and said I don't want you to feel uncomfortable so I will just have you as my birth partner. So I said just let me get the pram I want.

As soon as I said last night about the birth partner thing he said have someone else as your birth partner then I'm not ased, so I said so your not turning up for the birth of your baby and he said go find someone else as your birth partner. 

I am still in shock that he turned round and said that, it was all over text aswell making the situation ten times worse. He's been excited from day one, and I know he's highly stressed about a lot at the moment, but that comment has made me physically sick, angry and so upset. I don't want to get out of bed today because I feel really upset and hurt. I don't want to tell friends or family because I don't want it to make him look bad, because we normally r the best of friends. But I need to get it off my chest.

I don't think it would be worth getting quotes for refurb of kitchen, windows and bathroom as it is almost 100% certain that any purchaser would be massively extending (there's an 80' garden and room on the side of the house) as have the recent purchasers of neighbouring houses. This isn't an area where people will  be struggling first time purchasers but where people have plenty of money/City bonuses etc and the step up to a 4 bedroomed detached (costing around £1 million) in such an area is immense, so purchasing a character semi in a good area with extension potential fills the gap nicely.

So: house - plenty of kerb appeal and room for extensions though habitable whilst the decisions are made;
Area - excellent - quiet but close to amenities, well kept houses of all ages (Queen Anne onwards) in road;  
Surroundings - open space and village atmosphere yet not far from towns;
Transport links - two railway stations within 10-15 minutes walk - London in 20-30 minutes;
Neighbours - parents never had a problem in over 50 years (neighbours on each side have been there for over 20 years and aren't considering moving - quite a community feel and plenty of activities;

Our poor NVQ2 assistant had to deal with a school work experience girl, a placement student and about 14 children!
She was helped out by one of our parent's nanny who has an NVQ4 but she has been used so often and for NO XTRA PAY! That she has quite rightly put her foot down and is not helping as the parents who employ the nanny employ her solely to care for THEIR children.
We are trying to contact an agency for them to supply us with an NVQ3 person, but we won't know until the morning.
This will mean that the school will have to close but we only have a few in as its a rising 5's session.
But our chair is getting really fed up, especially as next week the pre-school manager and assistant need to leave school early due to training so we will lose an hour's session. And they are both going on a training day at the end of the month so the pre-school will have to have a supply NVQ3.

3570,"I think taking some space for yourself and also asking him consider his future is a wise decision.  And I do hope things work out.

But just be aware that chances are he's going to come back with some version of his old 'wait a year' song and dance and you have to be prepared to 'change the tune' to one that works for you.  And that may mean leaving the relationship.  

Another thing to consider (if you haven't) is that if he does say 'yes' to having a child and his motivation is to keep you, you may be facing a future in which you are 100% responsible for the child whilst he continues to live a 'child free' lifestyle with you shouldering the parenting burden. I mention this because my DS1 was in childcare with a little girl whose mum was in this exact situation.  Her 'd'H agreed to have the child she desperately wanted with the proviso that she would be responsible for ALL the child-related work.  Of course she was of the 'once the baby is here he'll love it"".  But by God he was as good as his word!  He did NOTHING, wouldn't even pick her up if she cried nor get up off the sofa to bring his wife a drink of water when BF.  His attitude was ""You wanted it, you got it, now deal with it"".  The marriage did NOT survive.  

I lost track of her then as she moved away to be near her folks, but for the short time between the breakup and her moving she realized how much happier she was without the load of her resentment against him.

So do think things through and question him closely if he comes back with a 'yes'.",2021-06-23 14:23:07+00:00,4277239,OH no longer wants children,relationships

She just doesn't get maths unless I show her with groups of stones for instance.  She doesn't get rote learning but she can do her times table.  She just doesn't seem to understand why she needs to do it.  She struggles with logic and mental arithmetic and she doesn't get sequencing.

Her reading has improved but her comprehension is going down hill.  Her spelling is erratic but not too bad.

She struggles socially and gets upset about having no friends.  From what I can gather, she often wants to play her games but nobody else does.  The teacher thinks she expects absolute loyalty and then gets stroppy and sulks. She has been like this since little.  

We obviously help her with homework, tell her that playing in turns is good and we invite friends over for tea.  She is in brownies now, which she seems to like.

I suppose the point of my post is to get some ideas or pointers.  It's really upsetting to see dd so miserable and calling herself stupid.

Can she have SEN needs without having a recognized disorder?  Her db is 6 and is suspected ADHD and the complete opposite to her.  He takes up alot of our time and energy which can't help things.  I wonder if she does have a learning disability that perhaps we should consider at least to rule some out?

I just feel like there's a chasm between her and the outside world and it's agonizing to watch.  At home she's usually loving and gregarious, particularly with adults and younger children.  She is brilliantly artistic and very imaginative, writing reams and reams of stories.  She just doesn't seem to fit into academic life with children of her age.

Granted they are retired so spend lots of time out there (pre covid) and buying it wasn't too complicated although there were quite a few hoops to jump through of course.

It has been amazing for us as a family holiday would cost close to £3k but we only have to buy flights so it allows us to visit several times a year.

The only thing I would say is they bought the apartment in a very popular tourist destination so it would be easy to sell if they had to. Just worth bearing in mind. And they also have someone who looks after it when they're not there.

3637,"Hi *spandau* - I had GD last time but no HG  and HG (obvs!) this time but target sugars (e.g. have to be below 5.5 in the morning and I am averaging 4.2. My daytime levels have to be below 6 and they average out at 3.8...) The docs are saying that I am ""clearly managing the GD through diet"" but that isn't true at all. I ate a leftover chocolate orange the other day to test it and sugars were ok. Spewed it up later but that was after I had tested my blood. 

The reason I was referred was that I couldn't take the GTT (410 ml of Lucozade in 10 mins - barf). I drank the stuff and then did an Exorcist inadvertently hitting a passing sonographer... The hospital said I would have to retake it but my midwife told them that I had failed it [hmm] so that I could avoid taking the test again. 

Having GD once seems to mean that you will get it again so I have been diagnosed despite meeting none of the criteria. This pregnancy couldn't be more different from the last one though. Like many on here I have needed to eat and drink the nutritiously null food like white bread and flat Coke to manage the spewing.

I ""lived in"" my other language for many years married to a native speaker who spoke no English. It felt right to speak that language with dd. At 15 months she has c.15 words/phrases in ""our"" language and a few less in English. She seems to expect there to be 2 words for everything now & already makes a choice of language (albeit with her v limited vocabulary) in different situations. She is very in to gestures too. There are times when I feel frowned upon but mostly that is from people who are monolingual & have no concept of living in another language. It seems less offensive to them with people with a parent from that country-even though they are non native speakers & do not speak the language fluently.

(I’m including the Daily Mail link because their report states that this happened around 4 pm as the 13-year-old was making her way back home from school, so presumably in school uniform.)

In brief: A 13-year-old girl was waiting at a bus stop when a 43-year-old man tried to entice her into his car. She refused. He continued his harassment by following the bus she got on and parked up when she got off the bus, and he threatened to continue following her. He only drove off when she alerted a member of the public.

He was traced via his car registration number that was captured on the bus CCTV.

A four-day trial at Crown Court, which resulted in a 9-month prison sentence plus restriction orders.

It would have taken a long time for the case to get to the Crown Court, which was bad enough for the girl and her family; but to have to wait it out for four days to see if he was found guilty must have been awful.

Of course this is the kind of behaviour that girls and women have been suffering for, well, ever. Some people complain that CCTV is intrusive; but it’s exactly this kind of case that proves its worth – behave in a pervy way in public, then you can get caught. Although, of course, some men think they behave however they want wherever they are – male privilege, innit?

It’s a groundbreaking conviction because the stalking law was used in this case for a brief episode of stalking, rather than over an extended period of time with many episodes. Providing the conviction stands, i.e. the offender doesn’t succeed in appeal, then it becomes case law, and can be used by the police and Crown Prosecution Service for other similar prosecutions.",2018-01-10 21:18:37+00:00,3136020,Stalker jailed – possibly groundbreaking result (at last),womens_rights

3747,"I took my ds on Wed for a Covid test as he had a sore throat and a weird rash.

Went to a walk-in site - was a marquee set up in a car park with a long queue. Everyone wearing masks, queue moving v slowly. When got inside the marquee, there were cubicles made with plastic curtains and everyone was given the equipment and sent off to a cubicle to do the tests ourselves. I got one too as they offereed, although I'd had no symptoms.

Took ds over 10 goes to do the test, as he kept gagging on the throat one and touching it on other bits of his mouth, so we were in there about 15 mins at least, obviously not wearing masks while doing the tests. 

We got negative results within 24 hours, BUT, this morning, 5 days after going for the test, I have now woken up with aching lungs, like nothing I've ever had. :(

Am now worried I caught Covid AT THE TEST CENTRE, as despite using copious hand sanitiser and wearing a mask outside, I was then standing in a small enclosed space where presumably hundreds of other potential Covid sufferers had also been standing recently, quite possibly coughing away without their masks on (as you can't do a test and keep your mask on).

As it was a marquee, it didn't ^feel^ like being in an enclosed space, but of course it was. Feel such an idiot, if I've actually caught Covid by going for a test.

So my warning is, if you do go for a test, a drive through where I guess you do it in your own car (?) is safer. 

And if you do do a walk-in test, only take your mask off for the absolute minimum time, and change clothes/shower when you get back. :(

I can't face going for another test to find out if this is actually Covid - apart from anything else, don't feel up to standing in the cold for another hour. :( And would have to share a car with my dh, as I don't drive, and wouldn't want to risk giving it to him.

Oh, and just to add, to add to the shitness, I am 99% sure I had Covid back in March, as dh had all the classic symptoms and still has the long-tail form, with some shortness of breath/lung pain 6 months on, while I got way then with just losing my sense of smell/taste for a few weeks. Assumed if I ^did^ get it again, I'd be OK. Bugger.

So don't assume that if you've had it before, you'll be fine. Obviously this may not be Covid. But buggered if I know what else it is, just random lung pain. [confused]",2020-09-27 12:08:59+00:00,4035173,Warning to anyone going for a test,coronavirus

3762,"Had letter through from Estate Agents this morning: 
 
 'With two recent increases in mortgage interest rates, people are asking is this enough to bring a slow down in the property market. Suggestions made by Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, earlier in the summer have encouraged purchasers to take great care when buying a property, and we would certainly endorse his views that it is dangerous to buy purely on the basis that prices are expected to grow by 10% each year. 
 
 Despite these concerns there is still considerable evidence in Altrincham that the market remains active. The overall economic picture remains strong and there continues to be an excess of demand over supply with relatively small numbers of new houses being built within the region. 
 
 For your property, as with others in the district, prices have risen considerably over the last two or three years and it would appear that this rapid growth in prices will peter out over the course of the coming months. We have had low inflation for a number of years and this is likely to result in a more stable market. We do not, however, anticipate a crash or a significant fall in property values as has been suggested in some quarters. 
 
 I hope you find this assessment of the housing market in Altrincham of interest to you. If I or any of my colleagues can be of any help to you with regard to any of your property matters either now or at any time in the future please do not hesitate to contact me.'

What have you told the school so far? You need to be open with them so they can help him make a successful start. At our secondary school they try to find out from the feeder primaries if there are children who for any reason are going to need extra support in settling in and they do a special induction programme for them. If your school does this, but your DS for whatever reason wasn't flagged up as likely to need it, he should still be able to access the extra support. The first port of call is likely to be his form tutor, but the main thing is to identify who in school is responsible for helping you access the support you need - there will be someone. They should be able to set him up with a buddy system or some other peer support to help him not feel so isolated.

You are right about GM - the concerns about this were consumer led - I was one of them. It was a minority issue. I remember contacting Genetix Snowball - they were the only people doing anything at that time. But food safety was a minority issue then. The media in particular were only just beginning to appreciate the long term
negative effects of certain food stuffs. The system was geared up to deal with someone getting food poisoning from a dodgy restaurant.

Things are very different now. Just because your children aren't physically ill after school dinners, doesn't mean you can't complain about the food they are being fed. That is a real sea change.

In an ideal world, tenants could have longer more secure rentals, they could leave and find another property easily or be able to access social housing. Unfortunately it doesn’t work that way.

I didn’t get any sex education, we were removed from all the lessons at school (yes, even the ones covered in science) and nothing was ever mentioned about sex at all at home. 

The problem is the only place to find anything out is porn, that was my only sex ed and the thought of having to let (because when you think it’s normal, you don’t realise that choice comes in to it) anyone do that to me was terrifying, but when you’re educated via porn you don’t know what normal expectations actually are. How I didn’t end up absolutely riddled as a teen is an actual miracle. 

If you want young people to have a healthy view of sex, then it’s something that needs to be talked about and normalised. Obviously finding the best way to achieve that is difficult, and there will always be someone that is unhappy, but the most important thing is fully informed young people who can be safe, say no and feel confident doing it, rather than being considered ‘frigid’.",2019-05-10 22:07:35+00:00,3582509,Stephen Fry backs P Tatchell's call to revise sex education,womens_rights

YABU.  The gun is much better.  Quicker, cleaner, easier, more direct for piercing ears. Why on earth anyone would choose a needle for it just baffles me.  [confused]

That said, no child should be allowed to have pierced ears until they are 13 or older.

I still to this day even wonder if the other buyer actually even existed because although it was in a popular area it had been on the market a good while and it just seems too much of a coincidence.

My mum suggested that he goes to a pre school near her house, but they want him to go to the one attached to the school he will attend. This is understandable in many ways, however if you have free child care, I feel that sometimes you need to make sacrifices and realise as long as its a nice nurturing pre school it doesn't matter which one they go to or if its attached to the school.

I work for a very large company in the city where I have been for almost ten years. They effectively give me the equivalent of  8 months paid maternity leave, and anything after that up until a year is unpaid. This is obviously incredibly generous - let me tell you that it is generous for a reason, they ask an awful lot of their senior employees. 

I came back in September after one year of mat leave, and I will shortly be telling them that I am pregnant with #2, and I want to start my mat leave earlier this time (mid July perhaps).

Do I feel guilty? A little bit, but I don't know if I should. I have worked incredibly hard for them for ten years, late nights (sometimes all night) and sometimes weekends, sacrificed any amount of personal commitments and done whatever they have asked of me. It is incredibly difficult to do my job as a working mother (they rejected my flexible hours request but I have an unofficial arrangement where I can leave at 5pm to relieve the nanny, then I continue to work - for however long is rqeuired - after the baby is in bed at 7pm) and every single day is a battle. I am completely exhausted all of the time.

Do I feel guilty about my contractual and statutory entitlement? Am I going to wait to have another child (I am early thirties) because it might not suit them? Erm no I'm not.

4010,"Hi OP.

I am glad you are getting counselling. 

I too became highly promiscuous in an extreme was following rape, twice in my life. For years I have tried to resolve who I feel I truly am, with who I was during those periods. The things I did and allowed to be done, haunt me.

I have had several yours of counselling and I have read as much as I can around the subject. The promiscuous behaviour is a trauma response to being raped. Coping with the utter destruction of your inner self. You had no control over who penetrated you, so you try to replace those memories by actively consenting to highly risky situations. 

I have never spoken of the things I did during these periods. They were do degrading and disgusting,  I thought I could never forgive myself. 

The thing is, during that trauma period you were extremely vulnerable.  Those who used and abused you, including this man, would have seen it from a million miles away. Your vulnerability would have shone like the sun. They exploited that vulnerability for their own sick agenda. 

During my time in trauma hell,  I did swinging, sex clubs etc with my 'owner' but I refused to engage with anyone else who was obviously vulnerable, which got me in a lot of trouble.  You can tell when someone is vulnerable, it's in the eye contact. Us damaged ones would smoke together,  but there was an unspoken knowledge that we were safe with each other, amongst predators. 

Those men knew. That consent was not true consent. You wouldn't do those things to someone who was suffering like you were.  It would revolt you. That guilt you are carrying,  it isn't your guilt. You need to give it back to all those people who saw that pain in your eyes, yet chose to abuse you. They are filth and deserve nothing but hatred from you.

This is not just her admitting hitting him, throwing things at him and even ""starting physical fights"". It's about more than that. This is recorded after all their supposed altercations have happened, it is after everything she will later accuse him of, it's just months before they filed for divorce in May 2016. The more important thing actually to take from this tape is the fact she spends the entire tape telling him she is upset/mad at him for ""splitting"", (meaning leaving the room or house), in past arguments/fights, instead of staying to argue and fight with her.  On what planet does a battered victim wife want their ""wife beater"" husband to stay to fight with them? They are more likely to be glad they left the room, or beg them to leave, I'm certain a victim wouldn't be upset or mad about their ""wife beater"" husband leaving the room during an argument/fight, and before anything physical happens.

She seems totally unconcerned about violence here, whereas he is concerned, he doesn't want to be in a physical altercation that's why he leaves, and she tells him he is using his desire to avoid physical confrontation as an ""excuse"" to ""split""/leave and not stay to argue/fight. She also is mad that he now leaves immediately at the beginning of fights when there has been no physical violence, which makes her angry and ""perpetuates the fight"" (listen to the entire tape, it's about this). When he tells her he left because she hit him last night she says what about all the other times he leaves when there is no physical violence, so tells him not to act like it's because of that. When he has already said he leaves because he doesn't want to be in a physical altercation, obviously he is going to leave before they start fighting. She also says he ""hits BACK, so don't act like you don't fuckin participate"". ""Back"" and ""participate"" being the operative words. 

Amber Heard: ""All the trust in the relationship is gone because you keep splitting. We fight together and you're the only one who splits and I.. I want that back but you...""

Johnny Depp: ""There's no trust there there's nothing.""

Amber Heard: ""Then maybe there's nothing to talk about but I did come over here with enough love in my heart and sincerity.""

Johnny Depp: ""Thank you""

Amber Heard: ""That all the things I said, that now I like... but I meant them you know, I fucking meant them. Even though you fuckin split and didn't come home. You know I still, I still did that. Fuckin I've shown myself, I've proven myself, I've fought for you, I've shown up""

Johnny Depp: ""I'm not gonna be in a fuckin physical altercation with you.""

Amber Heard: ""Then don't. Then don't""

Johnny Depp: ""You fucking hit me last night""

Amber Heard: ""What about all the other times you split (leave)? Come on you cannot act like that's about that.""

Johnny Depp: ""well on a plane I can't split""

Amber Heard: ""No, and you hit back, so don't act like you don't fuckin participate""

Johnny Depp: ""I pushed you""

Amber Heard: ""I'm not going to get into the details of that fight. You and I both know that you split when there is no physical violence involved, and that you do it immedi- like at the very beginning of fights these days. And if you split, and you go into a different room and you actually leave the house, it does nothing but perpetuate the fight...""

""If everyone just read the judgment ( I know it's long) you would see this idea of 'she attacked him first' is just untrue.""

Well here in this tape we hear from herself, she said she ""started physical fights"" herself, that's her exact words at one point in the tape, along with what I posted here and more. The Judge was not there I couldn't care less about his judgement really, what's it based on? Amber's words now. Well what is also Amber words in that tape, including she said she ""starts physical fights"", but imo more importantly she said she is angry that he leaves the room/house because he doesn't want to get into a fight. And more.

It's clear they get into arguments which escalate into fights which they both engage in, both have been physical to each other, throwing things at each other and other physical violence to each other, and it sounds like Johnny Depp does not want that to happen.

What she is concerned about is she doesn't want him leaving the room/house/going to his friend's house/getting a separate hotel room/sleeping in a different bed. That is the safety/security she is concerned about, the safety of feeling secure in their relationship, she says she thinks if he doesn't stay and argue/fight with her, and instead leaves the room/house and all those things I listed, that he doesn't care about the relationship and their relationship might end. She thinks if he is not staying to argue/fight with her that he is not fighting for her/for their relationship.

Listen to the tape, I know it's long, but this is from her own mouth. 
[[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aca0KWoHtqQ]] 

Actual audio of Johnny and Amber starts at 2:37 

Also, this part...

Johnny Depp: ""If things get physical we have to separate. We have to be apart""

Amber Heard: ""No we don't""

Johnny Depp: ""We have to be apart from one another. Whether it's for an hour, ten hours or a fucking day. We must. There can be no physical violence.""

Amber Heard: ""I can't promise you that I'll be perfect, I can't promise you that I won't get physical again. God I fucking sometimes get so mad I lose it.""

I know which one sounds like the spouse beater there and which one sounds like they don't want to be in a violent relationship. 

I wish I had a full transcript of that tape for people who won't/can't listen to it. If there is a transcript anywhere I'll try to find it.

I was following the trial as much as I could, the tweets from a channel 5 journalist called Nick I think. I just checked, Nick Wallis. He has court transcripts I started to read. I don't care what a Judge says, Judges can be wrong. We can judge what we read, hear and see as much as any Judge, especially after we read the entire court transcripts. I'm not going to ignore that tape and what I was following from trial transcripts (though I admit I've not read it all, yet). 

I'm not going to just be on the woman's side because we are both women. It's not just about whether she was violent to him, it's also all that about her being mad about ""splitting"" instead of staying to fight, which I find unusual to say the least for the victim of a ""wife beater"" . For those who think men can't be victims though, I will say my dad was a victim of my violent mum, who then gaslit and mentally abused me and him about it.  So it happens. When Amber mocked Johnny telling him to ""tell the world that you Johnny depp, A MAN, are a victim of domestic violence, and see how many believe you"", that pissed me off. 

Anyway, I'm not going to dismiss that tape. If people want to, on your own conscience be it. The Judge dismissed that tape apparently because Amber said something different under oath and he couldn't question her about it, and it was recorded for a different purpose? Lol. Awful. He couldn't question her in court about it?  Btw, media keep showing the photo of her face after Depp threw a phone at her which hit her face, that is violence, but that doesn't say ""wife beater"" to me. 

Oh and this witness testimony of her violence and lies about certain incidents from her/her sister's friend...

From Amber's own tape and own words it was a volatile relationship with violence from both of them, they got in arguments that escalated into physical fights, both were violent. From Amber's tapes Johnny didn't want that so he leaves/""splits"". She doesn't seem concerned about the violence as she wants him to stay and fight. Sorry I disagree based on what I've read, heard, seen, that he is a ""wife beater"", ""wife beater"" means something different to me. I don't care what the judge said. If he is a ""wife beater"" then she must be a ""husband beater"" then according to her own words. Why is it ok for her to be violent, and to ""start physical fights"", and to be mad and abusive towards him that he wants them to be apart from each other so these don't occur, and she wants him to stay and fight. This is on tape from herself, yet she is getting off scot free little miss victim, and he is being labelled. Any rare acknowledgement from her supporters/women's groups that she was violent is being framed as her ""fighting back"" and ""self defence"", that's not what it sounds like from her own words on that tape. If that is what the feminist board wants to go with, the lazy narrative, woman innocent victim, man evil. Fine. At least listen to the tape first. 

She even has a history of arrest for domestic violence, whereas Johnny's exes have all defended him, Vanessa Paradis and Winona Ryder defended him in this case and can't believe the accusations. I know that's not proof of anything and people can be different at different times/partners etc. but it's something. Also I remember when a tape came out of him upset and angry in the kitchen, he burned his hand on something from the microwave, kicked kitchen cupboards and slammed kitchen cupboard doors, he was drinking wine, she comes in to question and secretly film him, he's upset about something that isn't to do with her, I can't remember if it was about finances or his mother's illness/death, he just wants to be left alone. She doesn't leave him alone. He discovers she is secretly filming him and he grabs the phone and in the original video it cuts out and we were left to assume he was violent to her, this video was supposed to be proof of that. Well the full video came out during this trial and that was not the end of the video, he actually takes the phone from the kitchen work top throws it to the floor says ""goodbye"", walks out the room, she picks up the phone looks into the camera and laughs, and follows him.",2020-12-04 14:38:06+00:00,4067612,Johnny Depp loses libel case against The Sun,womens_rights

She was  a couple of months off 3 and I felt was physically ready, but she had some sensory issues and was a little delayed generally and very, very reluctant to train. I had a potty party for her, wrapped up lots of small gifts and put them in a bag for a lucky dip, and just took the nappies away.

I think half the time they, (the sons/daughters), know it is wrong and either try to pretend it hasn't happened, or get angry because they know it's wrong but are embarassed by it. It is only when a child comes along that they have to confront is as an issue.

As for what he said on Sunday, yes, can totally understand. They have no idea about how to behave appropriately with little children it seems. My MIL and FIL were supposed to be coming to visit one Sunday. FIL 'phoned in the morning and asked to speak to my son, (aged about 5), I told him he had gone out with my DH. FIL told me he was going to tell my son he wasn't coming over that afternoon - for a joke. I told him it was just as well my son wasn't in then because he would be upset and that it wasn't funny, my FIL was very surprised. Some joke.

Anyway, I digress, you hold the power here, (ie access to their grandchildren).

Yes, there are some truly spectacularly shit dads out there and the bar for fatherhood in society is set so low that it would be hilarious if it weren't so painful, but I don't think that should or can stop us from expecting that men are capable of performing *all* basic care tasks for their children if they want to be thought of as good, never mind fantastic, dads. I don't think he gets that cookie until he has demonstrated that he can care for them capably, and meet *all* of their basic needs, for, say, an entire weekend. And preferably not one you come back from to discover a shit tip of a house and that they have lived entirely off McDonalds since you left - in other words, one where he could have kept it up perfectly healthily as their routine rather than a ""just cope until Mummy's back"" scenario. If, God forbid, I died, I would have no worries about my DH's raising of my son, and I think that should be true for every dad.

PPs have pointed out your low expectations here and your struggles around vocalising this. I would suggest raising this with him and saying that you need him to start being able to handle all of their care, when needed, without support. Maybe try planning and working towards a weekend away for you, one where you can go away secure in the knowledge that he will care for them capably until you're back.

4206,"Hiya I took pregnacare with my 1st 2 prgnancies and was ill most of the way through. With baby no3 i started taking ""prenatal Nutrients"" by solgar,(felt great) they are much more easily digested than vitamins like pregnacare because they are made from extracting vitimins and minerals from food sources. Also there is a type of iron availiable from boots which is called spatone, it is actually water from a natural spring which is naturally high in iron, again it is absorbed really easily and doesn't seem to cause the constipation you can get with iron supplements.

As for not taking any supplements at all, it has been proven that the soil we grow our vegetables in contains about 60% less minerals and trace elements than in the 1960s. So vastly less vitamins are actually present in the food we eat, this makes it harder for us to ensure we meet our RDA's. Ultimately this boils down to it being only common sense to take a supplement!! As long as you eat a healthy balanced diet too and don't just rely on the vitamins for your nutrition then you are doing a good thing!",2009-01-04 00:41:51+00:00,630342,Pregnacare and Floradix/Floravital...?,pregnancy

Re Sacha, obv his behaviour - taking in a homeless vulnerable patient for sex - is abhorrent but I think the writers are brave to show how grief can absolutely change someone onto something unrecognisable.   It would have been easy to do Sacha sad, Sacha gets lots of comfort, a chat on the roof, drinks at the bar where they all rally round etc.  But grief isn't always that tidy.

However, this is what should happen next.  
She survives but loses the baby.  
(I do think it's Sacha's.  If he was infertile he'd have said so.  And she must be 16+ weeks when they were together.  I don't think she was out having random shags at that point because she was so devoted to killing off anyone Sacha loves.  )
Because she's in a bad way, they call next of kin and her Mom comes in.  We find out why they're estranged.  She finds out they had to do a hysterectomy to stop the bleeding and she breaks down.  Her Mom relents and talks to her and convinces her to go into therapy.  She sees Sacha to tell him about baby and renounces his treatment of her.  She leaves.  The end.

Sacha goes to the roof and HH follows him and they talk.  Sacha cries.  He agrees to time off.  He calls Jac and agrees to visit her in Scotland with NotKian.

He still might grow out of them.  They are not cause by anxiety but are worse if he's tired.

As pp has said, his wax and wane, sometimes they are awful, especially the multiple tics which involve a sequence of movements, for example, jerking his head back, pulling his shoulders down, bringing his hands up.

He can feel trapped by them at times and has callouses on his thumbs where he rubs them repeatedly.

We were told to not encourage him to hold or change his tics because he can't control them (well he can try for short periods but it's exhausting).

I sometimes give him massages to relieve his neck and occasionally pain relief if he gets sore because of one of his tics.

Ds2 is 6 and has ASD has some shocking tics at the moment but we haven't pursued a diagnosis for him as there's too much else going on.

4281,"Find yourself a family mediator and request that your stbexH goes to mediation. You have to pay for the sessions jointly but it's much cheaper than solicitors fees. It ranges from £120 to £160 a session. If you cannot be in the room with him request shuttle mediation but that costs twice as much. 

You want to draw up a parenting plan you both stick to and for the first year get him to agree to stick to the plan as laid out. You also have to do this as well. 

Before you go to your first mediation session research for information online on parenting plans and what to include. Also work out your child's routine and when she lives with both of you now. The parenting plan should extend from this. So if for example she sees her dad one night a week and every other weekend in term time then that's what you want in the parenting plan. If you haven't worked out how to deal with something for example school holidays ask around the people who are divorced or separated with children what they do and come up with something that is fair for your child. The parenting plan is for the best interests of the child and not about what is best for either of you. This means you have work at ensuring she sees both of you consistently and when she sees both of you is easy for her to understand. 

Only if you cannot agree can you go to arbitration or family court. If you do get a plan agreed and written up but your ex refuses to follow it for the first year as agreed, then again you can go to arbitration or court to get it legally enforced.",2019-01-20 16:09:16+00:00,3484555,Solicitors help,divorce_separation

The dentist also gave me a tube of Phillips 'relief' which you put in the trays and use for a week if it gets unbearable but I haven't needed it.

Mummy suddenly wouldn't read DS's favourite bedtime stories (my eyes broke apparently [grin]) and they became Daddy books as he went to Daddy in desperation to have them read.

On DH's work at home day he takes DS to a playgroup for an hour or two.

DH takes the DC's out by himself at the weekend at least once - to the park, to the supermarket, to my mum's. He now takes them to London on the train and in April is taking them to Italy without me.

I talk about Daddy and make him sound really exciting. If there is something they really want to do I suggest Daddy takes them. 

After tea I disappear and DH gets out a big pile of blankets and cushions and helps them build dens/forts with the dining table chairs. 

He bakes cakes and other fun stuff but he also does baths and changes nappies, I won't help even if DS is screaming.

DS is only allowed to look at the Ipad if she is sitting next to him and DS has discovered that Daddy will sing the long versions of songs that Mummy doesn't know - he will use his Iphone to get the lyrics whereas when I sing there is a lot of 'dum dum de de, lalalaa' where I don't remember the lyrics.

DS loves watching shuttle launches/planes taking off and monster trucks etc on YouTube but only Daddy is willing to do this.

Quite often if DS rejects DH then DH will go and loudly do something interesting in another room, which piques DS's curiosity. Especially if he is doing that interesting thing with DD and DS feels that she is getting something he isn't. He often goes through and then I stay where I am whilst they play.

4358,"Ok, I have an update. Maybe make a cup of tea , hell make a flask! 

Well just as the new year was dawning I asked her what her aims were for the coming year, was thinking she'd say ""sponsored rides, long hacks"" the sort of thing she was planning on last summer. Anyway it was then she admitted she had not realised how difficult and above all time consuming horses are so her plan was to loan out two of them and concentrate on one as she felt she was being stretched too much financially with no reserve if shit hits the fan and also she was starting to resent having to go down and tend to them as three of them takes a lot of her time.

So then she manages to loan out the older ex polo pony to a lovely chap who is going to use her for occasional polo, all she has even done is polo and the only reason she stopped was as the old owner was giving up polo whereas she was still happy playing. 

When the pony is collected my friend tells the farmer (who she rents the field off) that she is planning on loaning out another one and will just have one. He is not happy as he has been getting £50 per month per horse plus £50 for use of a field shelter (we're not using it as it's in the other field) and a storage container (which we are using) . He then says that if she goes to one he will be charging her more than £100 a month and will charge her for almost what she would pay for two horses. I'm not entirely sure what has been said but I'm guessing he is reliant on the income now and hasn't got any one else on the look out for grazing at this time of year as in the summer he was more than happy for her to have just one horse in the field.

Anyway I keep out of the financial discussions and she says maybe we should keep an eye out for somewhere else. So I did some online searching and everywhere was full or pricey , mentioned it to my friend who owns a section d I ride in exchange for poo picking and wine (that I have to thrust upon her as she is happy the horse is being ridden in the first place, but I feel guilty so feel I have to slightly pay my way somehow!). She then said ""oh there is a space next door""- and sure enough the yard next to ours has a space . 

This yard has a school and access to off road hacking ( that I know very well as it's literally 100 metres from a yard and horse that I've ridden for years). The yard does have space for two to move there but in the long term I think the yard owner prefers to have a bit of breathing space so we have been told we can keep two there for a few months but need to go down to one eventually. 

So we are still looking to loan one of them out , the Hanoverian to a happy hacking home as she is sound with the correct shoes on and is very easy going, whereas the polo pony we are keeping takes a while to trust people so she decided it was fairer to loan out the Hanoverian as she settled in with us very quickly compared to the polo pony who we couldn't catch for two weeks !

So overall the plan is to move at the end of the month and to actually start riding them again, and to find the Hanoverian a loan home. I feel it will be easier to find her a home once she is in regular work and they can also try her out whereas the other pony was loaned from the field.

I am also delighted that we will have access to a school, something which I've never had, it's always been schooling in sloped slightly dubious fields so to have a school will be amazing and will mean we can bring them back to work in a safe environment. Also they will both have a stable and will be coming in at night , so the mudfever which we are currently battling will be more manageable . And to top it off, there will be running water and lights!!! 

I am beyond excited and glad that she has finally realised she is collecting horses only to not actually ride them , so we are moving in the right direction.

The next stage is to move and then establish the correct bit for the ex polo pony so that on hacks my friend can stop and not have to pull herself off using a tree again :-/. The chap who has loaned the other polo pony said without a doubt she needs a cheltenham gag as that is all she will respond to as that's what they use for polo.

 I've done some research and seen that you need to ride with two sets of reins as you ride with the normal bit action then if you aren't getting response you can use the emergency rein to get a gag action. One question I have is are there different strength  levels of the bit as my friend has bought one with a rubberised straight bar , whereas I would have thought a French link mouthpiece would have been the mildest to start her off with. Also how the hell do you get the roundings in the bit the hole just doesn't look big enough?!

Hope I haven't bored you all senseless but thought it was time for an update , cannot wait to get moved in and settled and bring them back to work so we can actually start enjoying them. I am glad that she is finally seeing sense although I did nearly slap her when she said ""winter is so much less fun than summer , you do more work and spend more money with even less riding"" - I had been warning her of this all summer while she set about collecting a herd of horses.

I also kept on visualising this open gut and the thought of putting carrot etc in there was a bit grim.

DS is 3 1/4 and is just obnoxious in public, he really is. in a 1 to 1 situation he is delightful but in groups he is awful. Today, we were booked onto a guided walk for halloween at the local library and he was running off, not listening, demanding everything, stamping, screaming and shouting. I tried him on his reins and he was pulling and falling over. I'm having to use a stick to walk and he's pulling me over. I put him in the buggy, he screams and shouts. We're supposed to be on a guided walk, there's loads of others there, joining in with the songs and games. I couldn't inflict him on everyone else so I cut it short and went home. He's grounded in his room now. 
I admit, I have not approached this well in the past and have resorted to shouting and smacking at a final resort but I have adopted new parenting techniques with the aid of surestart and his nursery school. Nothing seems to work at all. DS decides he's going to do something and he's going to do it his way. 
I try hard not to let my illness (MS) inflict on his life and I try to give him interesting and enjoyable experiences but I am starting to feel 'why bother?' I may as well leave him in front of the telly with nothing to do.

 DH works hard, has a fairly reasonably paid job(we want for nothing, but we are not rolling in it either!) 
 
 Trouble is DH is a perfectionist, and I mean a perfectionist!!! This had lead to many an arguement over the yrs,(we have been together over 20 yrs!) If he starts a job, ie, the washing, he gets all huffy with me if I take the clothes out of the washing machine to hang up. trouble is saying that, if I put washing in the machine then he will not take it out(as he has not started the job!) 
 He strops with DC, until(which I hasten to add) I have strops with DC and then all of a sudden he is very pleasant to them! Luckily for DC I do not have strops with them that often! 
 He is very arrogant, his mother says he is very much like his Father was!(that ended in divorce). 
 I have a medical problem at the moment, its quite upsetting, yesterday had massive row about it, as I feel he does just not care about it, infact he said what good would any sympathy do if I gave it to you! ( he even admitted it!) 
 
 I guess after 20yrs, I am beginning to wonder if you can love someone and hate them at the same time! 
 
 I look at my house (which I love), my children (in which I adore) my little job that I have. I also heve the fear of sickness living over me everyday! Which stops me from doing things that yrs ago, I wouldnt have had a second thought!

4502,"Emotional eating is irrelevant when it comes to discussing whether telling parents they *must* do something about their fat kids. Comfort eating & eating disorders might make some fat adults over eat more, but I don't for one second believe being told your children's health and quality of life is at risk because of their lifestyle triggers the reaction of then feeding them more crap and reducing their exercise further. 

And let's be honest, not every overweight person has deep seated emotional reasons or medical reasons or an eating disorder. The majority don't. 

Loving the idea *grays* photo isn't healthy. I'm not even sure our modern stance on what constitutes a healthy size is entirely down to average size. Delusion and false confidence boosting is part of it. Because if you see the thin person as skeletal, the slim person as too thin and the chubby one as slim, you can tell yourself you are just a bit chubby. Start admitting people a lot smaller than you are a perfectly healthy and averagely slim size, and by comparison you'll have to admit you are too big. 

Perhaps people in the size 18+ range who's weight has slowly crept up over the years would tackle it long before they creep further up to the morbidly obese range if they weren't constantly bombarded with the message fat is a 'real woman' and 'curvy'.

4581,"It would be nice if young mums were not patronised so much. 

I had my children at 20&22 and I was spoken to and treated like a complete idiot on the postnatal ward with my second child.  I was stopped from carrying my baby into the day room for the group discharge meeting because I ""might trip and drop him"" and was ordered to go back and wheel him down in his cot. Out of 20 women I was the only one who been made to do this and all the others where holding and cuddling their babies. The only apparent difference between them and me was our ages. Everyone else was late 20's early 30's. I had a normal birth and was in no pain etc and was walking around and lifting things quite normally so there was no reason to doubt my ability to carry him. Halfway through the meeting the lady asked if anyone already had kids and I was actually the only person in there who did. funnily enough the patronising comments to me and nodding in my direction when discussing things that are common sense, such as supporting the babies head and changing regularly to avoid nappy rash, all stopped once that was established. 

I also had a nurse come over to see how breastfeeding was going. Before I could stand up to pick him up. She talked ^at^ me whilst picking him up and putting him in my arms. I hadn't even pulled my top up yet and  she was trying to position him for me and grabbing at my arms telling what to do. She went into a massive spiel about the different positions I can feed in once I've built up a bit of experience and how often I should feed etc. Every time I tried to speak she just spoke over me before I could get the second word out so I gave up and sat there quietly feeding whilst she went on and on about her superior knowledge of breastfeeding positions. She told me that she would be back later on to check his latch again and if I'm confident to feed him without her 'Help' I can go home. I told her that I had breastfed my first child until he was 18months old and I was more than confident. She visibly blushed, apologised and quickly shuffled out of the door. 

I don't think I could have felt more patronised on that ward if the staff had started patting me on the head.

Why should you have to apologize for wanting your mum when you had a prem labour? No, you hadnt planned to ask your mum but you hadn't asked to have a prem baby either?

Your DH should be considering what is it that you get from your mum that you don't get from him - and stepping up to the mark! Not sulking because he feels pushed out. The early days of having a baby are all about the mum. He should be waiting on you hand and foot.

Which leads on to 'list of household tasks' and 'exhaust myself having fun' - he really got you when you were down, didn't he? 

At the moment you are obvs overwhelmed and hormonal but if he carries on like this, you will be straight down the path to post-natal depression. It worries me how much headspace is given to his feelings and feeling guilty about him when 100% of both of your headspace should be making you feel great as that's the most effective way for your baby to feel great.

4637,"So, DP's DB and his wife have just had a baby. DP rings DB on Thursday to ask if we can round to see the baby for the first time on Friday. DB says no, they'll come to ours Sunday. DP says Sunday is absolutely no good because Sylvie is working all day (twelve and a half hour shift). DB says they will try to come on Saturday. Saturday comes and goes, no sign of them. Late Saturday evening DP gets a text saying they're coming on Sunday. Neither of us is happy about this, but DP is all like I can't get into a confrontation with them when they've just had a baby and refuses to talk to his DB about it. So I go off to work on Sunday and they and DP's mum come round with the baby, and DP gives them the presents I carefully selected, bought and wrapped months ago, and I'm left out of the whole thing! 

But it's not only this. I've never been able to build much of a relationship with them. DP and DB are not really close, they're quite different people. DP: bookish, sensitive, university-educated, teacher, teetotal. DB: laddish, a drinker, left school at 16, works in a factory. We've never seen him and his wife loads and when we do it is an effort for both of us.   

There have been a few things they've done that have pissed me off. For example, DB is our DS's godfather (DP's choice) but he has never taken much interest in him. 

DP lent DB £500 when I was pregnant with DS, which we couldn't really afford, and DB has never paid us that money back, though they have been on several holidays since and are now in the process of buying their council house [hmm]. (We, on the other hand, are finally going on our first holiday for three years this summer, as we haven't been able to afford it until now). DP refuses to ask for the money back and says we should just write it off. (It went towards paying debts). 

They never say thank you for birthday and Christmas presents, for themselves or for their kids. Ever. 

One time it was DP's birthday and we invited people round at four in the afternoon for a little party. DB didn't want to come at 4pm (he didn't have other plans, he just didn't want to come) so he turned up at 10 in the morning instead, with wife and two kids in tow! My friend from overseas was coming to stay that evening and I was rushing round trying to get the house clean for that and the official party happening in the afternoon, and somewhat stressed, so I stayed upstairs cleaning for most of the time they were here. After that DB complained to DP about me being ""unfriendly"", and came round less (his wife didn't actually come round again until this Sunday when they brought the baby over, which basically means she didn't come round for three years). 

Another time we went round to drop a present off for their DD. We were in a rush (my mum had given us a lift up there and was waiting in the car outside) so it was just a very quick visit, but it led to another complaint about my supposed unfriendliness because apparently I didn't say hello or goodbye (I don't remember this - I'm sure I must've acknowledged them with a nod or a wave). 

And one time, and this is a little thing but it pissed me off no end and now is my chance to get it off my chest (!), DB's DD threw up all over my settee and when he asked me for a cloth to clean it up with I told him to use the old cloth under the cupboard under the kitchen sink but instead he helped himself to a new one out of the packet, and it wasn't just any old cloth but a fancy M&S one, and of course it had to be thrown away afterwards so it was a complete ^waste^, and what made it even more irritating was that the DD had obviously thrown up because she'd been allowed to stuff herself stupid with crisps before they came over, it wasn't like she was ill or anything...!!!!

I've never said anything to them about any of these things (though with the cleaning cloth thing I really wish I had!!). One, I'm quite shy, and two, I think it's DP's place to deal with his family. I was brought up to be polite to people I don't know very well and that is exactly what I've tried to do every time I've seen them. My only crime, as I see it, has been my shyness. But apparently they now feel justified in leaving me out of big family occasions.

4649,"4SM - Are you me?  Actually no, I'm over 40 already.  My boy was put down 2 years ago now, just before my twins were born.  He was the epitome of bombproof coloured cob, but we showed a few WB's how to do it in the dressage arena (on a very good day).

Thankfully DH knows he is doomed - my plan is to return to horse owning when the boys start P2.  I should really get rid of some of the saddles before then!

I want an old style ID gelding, but I suspect I'll end up with another coloured cob - something about them draws me to them.

I've put on nearly 2 stone since he died - and he was mostly at grass and retired for a couple of years, some paddock maintenance, occasional muck out and hours and hours outside rather than in the house with packets of biscuits to fill the horse shape void!!

4653,"I taught secondary for 7 years until the birth of my third child in October last year. 

When I went on maternity for my last position, I was in a temporary contract (switched jobs for something closer to me) so there is no job for me to go back to. 

We are in the position to invest money in a business and we live in a touristy area by the coast. (Inherited a small lump sum of cash that I would be using as deposit for mortgages) I've been considering buying 3-4 holiday lets and running them as a full time business. I've taken a lot of financial advice and would be going into it knowing that it will be hard work and of course with an element of risk. I want to manage and clean them all myself as the figures don't work out so well if it is managed by another company. 

Is this the right thing to do? 

Things I've been considering: 

- Holiday let business does give me the flexibility to be there for my children a bit more, instead of constantly missing their nativity, or assemblies etc. 

- The overtime in teaching has got crazy recently, and I frequently used to work until midnight in the evenings, and one day every other weekend. I have an autoimmune disorder which is not great when I get stressed. 

However:

- Is it silly to come out of a good career (I can only describe the last few years as 'patchy' on my CV as I have taken time out to have my three children and switched areas/ jobs etc) and I think if I did this now, I would not really be able to get back to teaching much later if holiday lets didn't work out. 

- I feel as though I get a lot 'emotionally' from work, with colleagues often becoming friends etc. I feel very lonely from time to time and if I run a holiday let business, I will be working on my own all the time, probably rarely even meeting the guests etc. 

- Whilst it is possible that for a few years and when the children are small, this could work out well for me,  I might regret doing it when they are older - it will eat into the summer holidays which I could otherwise get off in teaching. Also, once they are in full time school and not so little, things could be easier to manage if I teach. 

I'm not considering doing both on a P/T basis - it just wouldn't work.

4673,"HI Muddlin' 
 
Been wondering similar things myself about DD who is 16mo. Only she has a bottle of milk on waking and milk with cereal not too long after. She then has another smaller bottle, often only 4oz at bedtime but more if she's still hungry. She eats mostly pretty well as mealtimes, so I don't think her milk intake is hampering her appetite too much. Only I read recently that at this stage they should only have 350ml, inclusive of all other dairy and she has yoghurt & cheese too. 
 
For snacks we have corn or rice cakes. I've discovered the corn ones recently and they are much tastier than the rice ones. Sometimes with hommous or fruit spread. Toast fingers, fruit esp avocado or banana, Satsumas in moderation as it's easy for her to eat a whole one but often the acid burns her bum, those little boxes of raisins are a huge favourite, bits of cheese, and occasionally plain biscuits or Organix fruit & seed bars. She's definately inherited mum's sweet tooth! I've tried carrot sticks but she's not too interested. Maybe one she has the molars she's currently working on. I'd be interested to hear of other ideas for snacks too as looking at that list it seems to lean towards the sweet side of things. 
 
Anyway, I'll be interested to see if you get any other feedback regarding milk. I started thinking about it after speaking to a friend who's boy is 18mo and no longer has any milk drinks other than on cereal and sometimes a glass in the afternoon. Perhaps this is the other end of the spectrum, she thought it was normal. I always thought they had milk at bedtime till 5 or something!!",2006-11-23 19:28:13+00:00,244327,meals/snacks/milk for 17 month old,food_and_recipes

Someone I know lied bizarrely and unnecessarily. They went on to develop quite serious mental health issues.

They felt, without really realising, that they weren't interesting and people wouldn't like them. The lying became compulsive but they didn't intend any harm. No one really said anything.

I'm not sure this can be entirely put down to grade boundary changes - the CA boundaries only changed by 3 marks, AFAIK - certainly a student with full marks for CA would have to do catastrophically in the exam (as in achieving perhaps an 'E') to only get a 'B' grade, as the CA is worth 60% of the mark.

4764,"If we make fruit and veg part of our meals everyday right from the start when we wean our kids, our kids will get used to eating them. If they prepare food and cook with us, and we teach them where fruit and vegetables come from we take away the mystery and fear of trying new things. If we make fruit and veg available to our kids to snack on instead of making it easier to grab junk food they will get used to it. Not all of us like everything but if we try we can always find something our kids like and then we can take it from there. My daughter hated cooked vegetables so I gave her raw veg instead. My son hated apples and oranges so I gave him strawberries and mangoes which he loved. Instead of reaching for a bag of crisps or sweets I always had dried fruit in my bag or carrot sticks for snacks. I didn’t force feed them or bribe them, I just let them try different things till we found things that they liked. As they grow up kids tastes change and mature. My 17yr old daughter still hates lettuce and tomatoes so when we have salad she has raw carrots and raw peppers instead. She has way more than her 5-a-day of the things she likes and tries new things when she wants to. It doesn’t have to be a battle. If your kids hate all veg make cakes and puddings using beetroot, courgettes and carrots. Cook fruit if they don’t like it raw. Give them raw veg if they don’t like it cooked. Who said a roast dinner has to contain boiled carrots and not raw ones. Does it really matter if they don’t like raw apple, bake them or stew them instead. Put grated carrot in a cheese or ham sandwich instead of the usual lettuce or tomato.

Will try to stop weighing daily soon.

Today I ate:
Breakfast: kallo + soy milk

You can add this owner to the moron list too please. They wanted to get rid of their GSD ^because he walks away when their child reaches out to him and they consider him a risk!^ [shock]

This is from the appeal for rescue which I put on Biggsd, using the owner's own words and report on the poor dog. Note that the dog had been left on his own for long periods, presumably still is, only the owner considers it not alone now they have another GSD [hmm] and that ""Rover's"" time is spent isolated from the family behind a gate, even when the DC is being supervised, and in the utility room.

Now tell me who's the stupid ones???? 

Rover is a 4 and a half year old KC registered black and tan German Shepherd boy. He is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and up to date with flea and worming treatment. He is in the family home in X although transport can be arranged to a new home outside of the area, subject to the completion of a questionnaire and a homecheck, under normal rescue terms.

He currently lives with a female German Shepherd in a family home. He is not accustomed to children other than his owners' 11 month old apart from on walks when he will let children come up and pet him. When out walking he will pull towards other dogs but shows no aggression - the owners say that this is out of nothing more than a desire to play. Their own belief is that Rover is quite a dominant dog.

Rover has never lived with cats or small animals. His owners say that he is not a fan of cats - this MAY be able to be overcome, as I'm sure you're all aware, and would need further investigation. He's considered an intelligent dog with a wide range of basic commands and excellent recall although he will pull on the lead. He's in good health and has never had any injuries or illnesses.

Rover's family consider that there are concerns about their child's welfare but it must be stressed that Rover has NEVER shown any signs of aggression and has NEVER attempted to hurt their child. The owners tell us that Rover will pull away from their child's attempts to stroke him and will walk away. The family's opinion is that on one occasion they felt that Rover used all his reserves of restraint in doing this and it for this reason alone that they wish to rehome him.

Rover and his housemate have always been kept behind gates and never in the same room as their owner's small child but the owners are now concerned because their child is getting more mobile and putting his arms through the gate. Rover has been living in the utility room of the owners' house where he doesn't have a bed because he likes to lie on the floor. He is very well behaved, not destructive and is house trained. Prior to the owners getting their second GSD Rover was accustomed to being left alone for long periods of time.

Finally, this is what the owners have to say about Rover overall:

""Rover is a lovely dog, he makes an extremely loyal and loving dog to the right owner. He is somewhat aloof at times but he loves a good bum rub and a brush and will let you know when he wants some affection. He is extremely emotionally aware of when we are upset angry and responds well to both! We would keep this dog if only he was better with our son, like our second dog who will actively encourage attention off of him!""

On other days, I really have to focus in order to feel anything and will have to drink a cold drink and lie down to feel these. 

I haven't felt concerned by this as there is now almost a pattern in their irregularity but when I saw the midwife last week she really told me off about this and said that if I notice any reduction in movements I should be calling the hospital. 

On Saturday I had a day of reduced movements so called the hospital who asked me to go in: 3 hours later (!!!) they hooked me up to a monitor where we could hear the baby's heartbeat and could see that the baby was moving continuously (I just couldn't feel it). The midwife said it is actually an extremely active baby!

I got my last dog when I was an 18 year old student, and I was very haphazard in my training style.  I gave her loads of time as my student lifestyle was none too demanding, and she did everything with me, including demonstrations against poll tax, the right to party in a field all night etc.  Haha.  Despite my haphazard training attempts, she was a very intelligent and loyal little mongrel and was mainly obedient and trouble free throughout her life, apart from the 4 years at the end when she was pleasantly demented and deaf as a post.

I really don't like to see unruly dogs and want to get it right with this new puppy.  I have 2 DDs aged 12 and 16 who will have a lot of time for the new arrival.  I have 4 cats who rule the roost and will be severely put out.  We have a large amount of land and live very rurally.

The policy said that any questioning about people with male bodies of female wards is akin to racism/ homophobia.

4953,"I can remember (in the late 1990s,) the women at work who were born just before 1960, being really smug, and laughing at me, (and other women born after 1st January 1960.) Because the women born before 1st January 1960 got to retire at 60 and the ones born after it, had to work another 5 years.  They actually LAUGHED, and mocked us.

So when things changed, and these women were made to work to the same age (65-67,) it made me laugh at ^them.^  And I am not even remotely sorry.  [wink]  

Then again, I am all FOR women retiring at 60 (as we all work much harder in general through our lives than men,) but it has to be ALL WOMEN, not just the ones born before 1960.  Many women born in the 1960s and 1970s, and 1980s, have worked much harder and had much more stressful lives than women born a decade or two earlier.

No way in fucking HELL should anyone be working to the age of 70.  That's a piss-take.  Even being expected to work til 66-67 is a disgrace.  People have very stressful lives these days, and many people are living on or below the poverty line.  

The health of lots of people starts to decline at 60-63 or so. Despite some people claiming their great auntie Fanny who is 103 still runs a marathon a week, and their granny Annie is 111 and started work at 9 and has worked for 102 years.

The fact is MOST (hard-working) people are ready to retire at 60.  Who the fuck wants to work past 60?  Unless you have a blessed life, lots of money, and a very fucking easy job, you must have rocks in your head to want to work past 60.

Also, as has been said, many under 30s stayed in education til 21-23 y.o, and then had a 'gap yah,' whereas many women from the generation before started work at 16, and it was often manual labour, like a factory job.  So you BET we deserve to bloody retire at 60!

And the comments from several posters about women wanting to retire so they can go on cruises that are funded by the millennials, just fucking do one mate!  Most women born in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, have worked fucking hard and paid a LOT of taxes over the years, so just bog off with your pathetic straw man shit.  You millennials are funding FUCK ALL mate! [hmm]



All women should retire at 60, and men at 63.

Fair enough, it was obviously supposed to be rustic.  I ordered lamb stew.  It was full of gristle and carrots to fill it out, and had hardly any potato to soak it up.  So I asked for some potatoes as a side order to go with it.  10 minutes later the waiter came back ""the chef says its meant to be eaten without extra potatoes because that's the style of the dish blah blah"".  ""No, I want extra potatoes as a side order"" I said.  15 minutes later they arrived.  By this point the gristly stew was even more inedible.  It was vile, fatty and with unidentified unchewable hard lumps of something.  I gave up and didn't eat it.  Expensive and overcrowded, obviously couldn't be bothered because they were packed.

I also went to an over-rated little country inn place once and ordered a ""bacon and salad herb sub roll"".  A supermarket roll with two rashers of bacon and absolutely nothing else appeared.  Not even chopped.  There was a small piece of lettuce lying beside it on the plate.  £7.95!

Best service: DH and I were on holiday in France and got hungry one Monday evening while driving to the campsite.  We stopped at a restaurant in a small village.  We marched in, to find one family sitting down to a meal.  Emboldened, we sat down at the nearest table and were surprised when one of the other table came over to tell us what the menu was.  Baffled, we ordered, although we didn't speak French.  The dinner came and it was exceptional.  You could not have tasted better at a Michelin 5 star restaurant, although the ingredients were quite simple.  It was just delicious.  We had pudding too.  It was equally good.  There didn't seem to much choice, as far as we could tell, because our French fellow diner/waitress had limited English - she was really helpful when she realised we spoke no French.  The people were delighted and smiling when we told them how much we had enjoyed it, and we left a nice tip.

Later at the campsite, we told other campers about this great restaurant we had stumbled across.  And were told everything was closed, it was a local bank holiday.  We had walked in on a family eating a private meal on their one day off, interrupted them, and sat there virtually silently, demanding to be fed.  What must they have thought of us?  And they couldn't have been nicer!

""But then this is the whole 'women shouldn't actually like or enjoy sex, they're just there to facilitate men's sexuality' bullshit isn't it? Just shut up and tolerate it.""

Umm, wtf? I'm a woman and enjoy sex very much. There's really no need to derail with imaginary political subtext. If a woman had a private fetish that her husband wasn't into and he was going to leave over it, I'd find that equally strange. 

To get back to OP's situation, it doesn't sound like he has an entirely separate sex life. It sounds like he has a particular activity that turns him on but that he knew OP a) wouldn't be into and b) would probably freak out about, so he's kept it to himself. If I found out something like that, I wouldn't see it as a massive deception so much as...well, the way  *albertcampion* explained it perfectly.",2016-05-30 11:33:21+00:00,2649287,To split from my DH because of his cross-dressing?,am_i_being_unreasonable

Be less available. You might want to include info in your email sig - office hours are between x and y and I will be available then to discuss assignments, for other support contact these people instead. And that doesn’t mean you’re neglecting your pastoral responsibilities- it’s about reinforcing professional boundaries.

There are enough students these days who will drain you dry if you let them with their constant requests for support and wanting you to engage with their problems of varying degrees of severity and only tenuously linked to the course. You don’t have to fix everything for them.
