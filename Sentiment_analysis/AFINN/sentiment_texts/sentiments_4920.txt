- When it comes to 'healthy eating' are there any things that you feel particularly confused about? If so, what are they? Why are they confusing?

Not really, there is a lot of information out there now about healthy eating and I think that food in supermarkets are generally marked more clearly now. I'm pretty good at reading labels for food and we always cook from scratch so I more or less know what is in the meals I make. 

- Is providing your family with a healthy and balanced diet something that you feel confident about? If so why, if not, why not?

I absolutely feel confident about knowing what constitutes a healthy diet and we try and stick to healthy most of the time. I am guilty of 'treating' the children probably too much at times, although this is usually alongside either a sporting activity, or something like a day out. 

- Please share your experiences on how you go about sourcing the right nutritional advice on providing a healthy diet for you and your family.

I search online for healthy recipes. I like cooking anyway and have always cooked from scratch. I am always on the look out for new meals to try, or any kind of inspiration really. I use some cook books and also watch some cooking programs. I will often adapt meals or substitute ingredients to make a dish more healthy. My mum has always been a pretty good cook so we swap and share ideas also.
