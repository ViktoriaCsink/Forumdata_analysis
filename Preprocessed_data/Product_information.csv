4159534,DH lost laptop and now assignment will be late,am_i_being_unreasonable,2021-02-08 20:32:56.000 +0000,"Yay! Glad you found the laptop!

Perhaps have a rule that he's not allowed to borrow your laptop at all. Sounds harsh but if it's that vital for your course maybe it needs to be off limits so this doesn't happen again. There's no way he can guarantee that he won't place it somewhere random again (without thinking) at a vital moment for you so you have this stress again.  

I have ADHD btw. I wouldn't want responsibility for something so important to someone else. He should have his own laptop that he can then leave where he wants. 

One further thought - I found this book amazing for ADHD friendly organisation tips. The best book I've read and has really helped me at home:

And he really has to stop the major organisation all at once. I have done this soooo many times and have realised I have to do small bits at a time. Otherwise I end up with EVERYTHING out everywhere and then lose all momentum and get really overwhelmed and don't know what to do with anything.  And then it sits there for weeks and weeks. No massive sort outs needs to be the rule. 

And if you need to do one, do a planned one together. I find it much easier to sort the garage for example if my husband is able to help keep me on track and focussed on the task and not get sidetracked and also he helps when I get stuck and don't know what to do with something. Which can lead to buffering. 

Anyway waffling again. So will go now. Hope some of that helps!

When starting with fruit, you can make apple sauce but simmering piece of apples in minimal water. Pear sauce is equally delicious, and pear will develop a sort of vanilla taste when cooked.

I know I've been reading more than usual just to avoid the squabbling from the DCs...

Thank you very much for your thoughtful reviews, *Keith* - I really enjoyed reading them!

Thank you also to *southeastdweller* for keeping these threads going all year (and for heeding our pleas for a final 2020 one - I've got lots of reviews to catch up on and would feel weird putting them on a 2021 thread!)

I'm now on books 95 and 96 (and am wondering whether I can push through to 100 with a bit of judicious children's book reading, or whether this is a futile goal and I'm only cheating myself [grin]) so I'm going to update in batches as I can't face doing all of the reviews at once.

*The Carer by Deborah Moggach*
Enjoyably tart book about two late middle-aged siblings whose lives are turned upside-down when their father gets a new live-in carer. At first, Robert and Phoebe see Mandy as a complete â€œtreasureâ€ â€“ yes, sheâ€™s a bit â€œcommonâ€, but she seems devoted and enthusiastic about her work and they are relieved that they can pay her to do the caring that they donâ€™t want to/canâ€™t do themselves. But their father (an octogenarian professor emeritus of particle physics) seems to be changing oddly under Mandyâ€™s influence, and the siblings start to wonder if all is as it seemsâ€¦ Things come to a head halfway through the book (not in the way that Iâ€™d expected!) and all sorts of things come out of the woodwork; the second half of the book examines the fall-out and the events leading up to it from various perspectives. Iâ€™d assumed this was going to be a Sophie Hannah-style thriller with a devious â€œtwistâ€ but it wasnâ€™t like that at all. Instead, Moggach casts a rather beady eye on family relationships (between parents and children, between siblings, and between spouses), on ageing, and on the interplay between money, intelligence, success and opportunity. The characters are realistically unlikeable at times and, although thereâ€™s a certain amount of social satire going on, there isnâ€™t a lot of flab either. I enjoyed this a lot!

*The Deaths of December by Susi Holliday*
Competent police procedural that I bought in a charity shop last January and have been saving up for Christmas this year. A serial killer (referred to for most of the book as â€œThe Photographerâ€) sends a grisly advent calendar to the local CID; behind most of the doors is a photograph of a crime scene from an unsolved murder, which only the killer could have taken. Needless to say, there is also an elaborate code involved, linking dates, locations and numbered doors on the calendar. Can the police catch the killer before the last few empty doors are filled? (Yes, of course they can.) There was nothing earth-shattering about this book, but the writing was not terrible and the exploration of the charactersâ€™ back stories raised it above many other pot-boilers of this type.

*The Thirteen Days of Christmas by Jenny Overton*
A childhood favourite that I havenâ€™t read for ages, which was brought to mind recently by a conversation with DD (and I see that *ChessieFL* also read it very recently). I was fretting that it wouldnâ€™t live up to my memories of it, but I neednâ€™t have worried â€“ it was wonderful [smile]. The four Kitson children live with their widowed father Ralph; the oldest daughter, Anne (who prefers to be known as â€œAnnapleâ€ because she has romantic notions) is being wooed by the wealthy young merchant Francis Vere, but wonâ€™t have him because she feels that he is too prosaic. The younger three children conspire to get Annaple married off (partly because theyâ€™ve had enough of her terrible cooking), and egg Francis on to think of more and more ludicrously romantic gifts to present to Annaple on each of the twelve days of Christmas.

Like a lot of my favourite books from childhood (it was first published in 1974, and I would have read it in the mid-1980s), it involves a historical setting â€“ weirdly, this is never mentioned explicitly, but judging from Shirley Hughesâ€™ illustrations, I reckon itâ€™s some time in the second half of the 17th century. The setting, the understated period details and the spare but evocative language all meant that this was a magical read for me â€“ like *The Children of Green Knowe* and *The Dark is Rising*, both of which Iâ€™ve also just re-read. Like those books, it is really wonderful at evoking atmosphere â€“ each of the chapters is titled with the relevant feast for that day (so not just St Stephenâ€™s Day, but also Churching Day, Adamâ€™s Day, Eveâ€™s Day and Dancing Day). The celebrations and carols for that day frame the action, and give a real sense of Christmastide as a time for communal celebration rather than just personal feasting/present acquisition or sickly â€œfamily timeâ€ as modern books tend to emphasise. I donâ€™t know why itâ€™s taken me so long to re-read this (probably because it was in a box under my bed until a couple of months ago [blush]) but itâ€™s definitely going to be a regular re-read from now on!

*Dead Famous by Greg Jenner*
I started this months ago and then got bogged down and distracted by other books. Once Iâ€™d got going again, I flew through it! Itâ€™s an entertaining but fundamentally serious-minded look at the history of celebrity: when did we start to have â€œcelebritiesâ€, what is the difference between â€œcelebrityâ€, â€œfameâ€ and â€œnotorietyâ€, and how did people become (and stay) famous in the past? There are loads of colourful and entertaining anecdotes, as you would expect, but there is also a serious attempt to grapple with cultural theory and to put it in its proper context (as the historical consultant for Horrible Histories, I reckon Greg Jenner is probably uniquely suited to this job). Chapters cover the routes to stardom, money, celebrity bodies and merchandise, and everything is meticulously referenced (he mentions in the epilogue that it took him 6 years and 1.4 million words of notes to put this book together, and I believe it â€“ it even spills over [[https://www.gregjenner.com/dead-famous-full-references-bibliography/ onto his website]]!). Among the more obvious suspects like Byron, Lizst and WG Grace, you get to find out about the now-forgotten stars of their age, like the firebrand Tory clergyman Henry Sacheverell (arguably the first modern â€œcelebrityâ€), the sultry dancer ClÃ©o de MÃ©rode (whose affair with King Leopold of Belgium led to the brilliant portmanteau nickname ClÃ©opold, and whose fans were creepily obsessed with her ears), the â€œdivine Master Bettyâ€ (a Regency child star who was a cross between Shirley Temple and The Beatles), and, er, Clara the Rhino (who was the hottest star to tour 1740s Europe).

*A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens*
Havenâ€™t read this for years, but it was a lovely way to spend Christmas/Boxing Day (I listened to the Hugh Grant version that Audible are giving away free at the moment). Iâ€™d forgotten how funny some of it is!

*Grimble and Grimble at Christmas by Clement Freud*
Another book I havenâ€™t read for at least 20 years! Grimble is a boy of about 10 (â€œYou may think it is silly to say someone is ^about^ ten, but Grimble had rather odd parents who were very vague and seldom got anything completely rightâ€). This book is really two long short-stories put together. In the first, Grimble comes home from school one Monday to find an empty house; his parents have left a globe with two flags stuck in it, one in England (saying â€œGRIMBLEâ€) and one in Peru (saying â€œUSâ€). Further notes around the house (his parents like leaving cryptic and sometimes trolling notes around the house) suggest five different people he can call on while they are away, from Colonel Featherstone to the station master. Each day, he calls on a different person, only to find that they are also mysteriously out and have left him notes with instructions on how to make dinner. In this way, he manages to spend the time until his parents return. The second half is about Grimbleâ€™s attempts to earn enough money for a â€œproperâ€ Christmas because he thinks that his parents will be too forgetful/disorganised to do it themselves (not quite as sad or neglectful as that makes it sound!).

The book is illustrated by Quentin Blake, and is a bizarre mixture of surreal humour and cookery advice (Clement Freud was both a food writer and an MP when he wrote this book) that was right up my street. To give you a flavour of it: [Grimbleâ€™s parents have sent him a telegram saying â€œTHINKING ABOUT YOU. MESSAGE IN THE IRONING CUPBOARD. DONâ€™T FORGET TEETH. LOVE FATHER AND MOTHER.â€]

â€œHe went up to the ironing cupboard, rummaged about a bit among the clothes, and finally in the pocket of his bathing trunks he found the message. It was written in green ink on a large squashed-fly biscuit and said, DO NOT EAT THIS BISCUIT BECAUSE EATING GREEN INK IS BAD FOR YOU. LOVE FATHER AND MOTHER. â€˜If that is a grown-up joke I am glad I am a child,â€™ though Grimble, brushed his teeth angrily, and looked at the list of people his parents had told him to go and see if he needed anything.â€

*Ruth's First Christmas Tree by Elly Griffiths*
I downloaded this 6 months ago as a [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ruths-First-Christmas-Tree-Galloway-ebook/dp/B009P1WFEY?tag=mumsnetforu03-21 Kindle freebie]] and this seemed as good a time as any to read it.

DH argued a LOT after DC1 was born and we ended up having couple's counselling as things didn't improve. That helped us massively. Now DC2 is here we are arguing again so I suppose it's inevitable. I'm wondering whether we should have some ""refresher"" counselling. Anyway, don't know if that's helpful but you're not alone!

One thing that pisses me off is that I do all the research, I do obsessive Googling, asking friends for advice, reading Mumsnet thread, reading parenting books... but he does fuck all. I'm also the one doing the vast majority of the childcare (breastfeeding so doing night feeds and also on maternity leave while he works). So actually I get final say if we can't agree. If he doesn't like it, tough! I have told him that I'd like us to make parenting decisions as equal and he does have the right to a say so perhaps he could kindly educate himself and then we can have a conversation. Funnily enough he never fucking bothers. He does listen to me though thankfully. If he refused to listen or research I'd probably tell him to fuck off.

About your baby's digestive issues - sometimes they can be caused by cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) although if your baby is tolerating formula that's probably unlikely. You mentioned that you had a c-section. Sometimes probiotics can help, BioGaia baby ones are good.

Expressing can be tricky but some people find it easy. I think the key is to remember that when you're expressing, you're really getting the ""excess"" milk. Babies are more efficient than a pump and when a baby is feeding, you're getting all kinds of biological feedback which signal to your body that your baby is feeding and hence make more milk. A pump only really recreates two of these signals - the removal of milk and the sucking action (nipple stimulation). What you don't have is oxytocin, skin to skin, the smell of your baby and the hormonal feedback. You can often train your body to produce more by expressing regularly, indeed, that's what happens when someone exclusively pumps milk or pumps a large proportion of their baby's milk. But if you don't pump regularly, then you'll find as your milk supply regulates over the first 3-6 months and you stop leaking etc, you'll stop producing excess and then if you want to express after this point, you'll probably find you don't produce anything for the pump any more. It is then possible to increase pumping supply, but if you just want to do it as and when for the odd evening out etc, I (personally) found that wasn't really possible after about 6 months.

A lot of people like the idea of expressing for a bottle for their partner to feed, in reality I think this can end up being more work for you than you save by having your partner do one feed! Especially if you end up responsible for cleaning and sterilising the pump and bottle, organising storage of the milk, etc. OTOH, if you find you leak a lot, you can use breast shells or there's a ""passive"" pump out now called a Haakaa, which can be used to collect run-off milk that you're leaking, for example during feeding your baby, which is a common time to leak. This can then be decanted into a bottle to use as an extra feed, which can be no effort at all! But it doesn't work for everyone. I didn't leak a lot with DS1 and not at all with DS2.

I don't think nipple confusion is as big of an issue as people seem to think it is. Maybe for very tiny babies who are still learning to latch. I suppose it's good to be aware of it as a potential problem, but I def wouldn't get too hung up on it. OTOH a lot of people think if they introduce a bottle too late, then babies won't take to them at all but I don't think this is true either. Bottle refusal just seems to be a random thing that some babies decide to do at about 3-4 months old, and they will do it whether they have had a bottle beforehand or not.

I would say that 10+ hour cluster feeding sessions are rare (and tend to spread into the night if that happens anyway). If it gets too much at any point, you can always just put the baby down and go to another room. Yes, they might cry, but even if what they really want is milk, dads or other people can develop calming strategies for babies all of their own, and if there really is nobody else, they will be OK while you get your breath back for 5 minutes. Cluster feeding is common, but it's normally more like 2-3 hours at a time in the early evening, at a time when you generally want to be sat on your bum watching TV anyway, so it's not tooo bad to be immobile, it can be quite a nice excuse! Or set up your bed for safe co-sleeping (even if you don't want to do this as their main sleep space) and doze. Buy your partner a cookery book now if they don't currently cook [wink], batch cook for the freezer during late pregnancy and getting acquainted with a slow cooker and your local takeaways is also not a bad idea, because it does tend to happen right at tea time and breastfeeding makes you hungry. Cluster feeding is wearing but I think if you're expecting it, it's not quite as bad as if you are expecting them to feed for 10 minutes and then be put down for the next 2-4 hours.

Midwives in theory should be able to help you with establishing feeding, but unfortunately they don't all have good training or experience with BF... sometimes their advice can be really good, but sometimes it can be incomplete. I'd recommend that anyone who wants to BF locates a source near them which is reliable - whether that's a book or helpline or a support group or an IBCLC - it's just unfortunately a bit of a postcode lottery and a lot of NHS areas don't have breastfeeding support on staff, other than the very basic training midwives have (which might have been years ago and half forgotten). Health visitors aren't usually trained in breastfeeding, and neither are GPs. Hospitals tend to want you out ASAP even in normal times because they need the beds! But you should get midwife home visits up to about day 10 before being discharged back to HV.

4086583,9DPO Symptom Spotting,conception,2020-12-29 14:10:48.000 +0000,"I got good news this morning. HPV letter arrived!! The spotting made me start googling 'signs of cervical cancer' because at this point, my body may just straight-up hate me but at least I'm infection free. Yay! The spotting is settling down now anyway and should hopefully stop tomorrow so we can start with DTD. I also booked an appointment at the fertility clinic for DH and I. We'll be going next Tuesday! Wish us luck!! Have you started looking into fertility checks?

I haven't changed my vitamins but maybe I need to stop or cut back? I could take the B-complex for now and stop everything else. But I don't really think it's the vitamins. It's defo hormonal and it's semen or conception or failed-implantation induced - just not sure which one.

I'm right here with you with all the alcohol drinking. I've had a drink everyday since Xmas. We've also been sleeping and waking up late - only God (and DH) knows what my temps are doing. Hopefully you're able to see a clear temp shift despite it all. I'm still a week away from ovulation!

Haha I ordered [[https://www.amazon.com/FertilAid-Men-Fertility-Supplement-Morphology/dp/B0006HDOSM?tag=mumsnetforu03-21 these]] for him as well as the ones for sperm count and motility (just in case). They have really good reviews but I only thought he'd need to take three separate pills, not 3 of one, 2 of another and 2 of another. Oh well! The things we do to keep the wife happy.

Haha I can imagine your DP begrudgingly wearing the PJs. But like I said... The things we do to keep the wife (or fiancee) happy ðŸ˜‚ Me too! PJs all day everyday. I actually ordered five more so that I had a nice rotation available.

A maxi dress would definitely be what I'd go for too with that fabric - so pretty! I think you should leave it baggy and create a waist belt for it. That way you can tighten it around your waist but have the loose, flowy look too.

I've started using visualisers to see what rugs and tiles would look like in the new house. I really like this beige rug. I think it suits the floorboards and the fireplace. And the bathroom currently has blue floor tiles which I want to paint a dark grey/slate colour. But I still don't like the blue trim on the walls so might replace them.

4086583,9DPO Symptom Spotting,conception,2021-02-04 11:55:06.000 +0000,"Yay! Go temps go! Glad it's progressing so well for you! Fingers crossed for a longer LP and highest temps ever! Just checked your overlay chart and these are your highest temps at 7DPO so far! How exciting! My temp did exactly what it did last cycle. At 5DPO it flattened and I have a flat temp today as well. It might start going up from tomorrow. I'm thinking secondary estrogen surge keeping my temps down?

Oooooo imagine if you have a little bean in there right now searching for the perfect spot to snuggle into!!! Hopefully over the next few days, your temps will shoot up ðŸ“ˆ I know charts can't show or predict pregnancy so early on but it'll be really interesting to see what happens.

I'm feeling a bit bleh this morning. Have a bit of a headache. I've been having them on and off over the last few days. Quite tired too so feeling a bit groggy. My leg is much better! I asked DH to give me a massage last night and he decided to unleash the strength of a thousand oxen onto it, nearly took my skin off - but it must have worked! I guess the pain was muscular ðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸ symptom spotting isn't fun when there's a logical explanation ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜‚ I'll need to remember to do my progesterone test tomorrow too!

If I get a BFP this cycle, I want to buy [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07Z3Y5ZP4/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=A2RCXAQDK3T42M&psc=1&tag=mumsnetforu03-21 this box]] and put the HPT inside it and give it to DH on Valentine's Day. It's such an overdone thing to do but I think Valentine's Day would be the least suspicious time to do it because people generally exchange gifts then (although the box shape might be a dead giveaway. I'll have to choose another shape.) Would you tell your DP straight away if you got a BFP or wait until Val's Day?

I remember when my mum was pregnant with my siblings. Excess saliva was one of her symptoms. She used to carry around a bottle to spit in ðŸ¤¢ I really hope I don't get that!! Do you remember any of your mums symptoms through her pregnancies?

I *could* sleep on my side if I tried. I seem to go through cycles where my sleeping position changes. I used to sleep on my side quite a lot but for some reason, I prefer my front now and can't sleep on my side anymore. But those pregnancy pillow sound like a dream! I'll take two please! 

I can't remember tbh, it couldn't have been too long after we started dating. The full story is now one of those stories you tell amongst friends and laugh your head off. I wish it was my most embarrassing story too, but I've had worse happen to me. What's the most embarrassing thing to ever happen to you?

The funny thing is, I have the biggest boobs in my family (so far, as my little cousin seems to be catching up) I think it's from the paternal side of me. My sisters and I have different dads and they're both flat chested. Is there a feature that all your family members have inherited? In my family, it's our lack of a bum and waist. We're not a very shapely family - we're all very boxy ðŸ“¦ðŸ˜‚

He has an exercise bike too! He doesn't use it. That's why I'm even more annoyed ðŸ˜  If we created an outdoor gym, that would be great because then the equipment would have a dedicated space. I want to buy [[https://billyoh.com/tessa-summerhouse/26233 this]]. We have a hot tub too so I'd be looking to put it inside something like [[https://billyoh.com/holly-summerhouse/26099 this]]. Then at least we'd have a gym area for fitness and relaxation (obviously I won't be using the hot tub as I don't go inside water). Since you have a big garden, you could erect an outdoor building. It might be cold in winter without any insulation but a cool environment is great when you're working out â„ï¸ðŸ¥¶

ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜± What! Sleep can affect fertility. That's crazy! The body has to be a perfect system or else, it seems, if something is out of balance, it can impact other areas of the body ðŸ˜± Gosh, there seems to be 1001 reasons for infertility and pinpointing it must be impossible.

You have the unique opportunity to shape your baby's taste. Focus on the food you want him/her growing up eating. You want your baby to eat vegetables , give vegetables, and stay away from ultra processed baby food (puffs, veggie sticks, baby crisps, cereal bars, ....). 
Even minimally processed baby food should;d be the exception and not the rule. 
Be mindful that pouches and jars don't taste like their fresh food equivalent, and a baby will develop a preference for the taste that is given. A lot of pouches also have sweetness as a dominating taste, so use sweet veggies such as carrot, sweetcorn or add fruit to veggies to make it more palatable. 
Baby porridge is very sweet.

The main point will always be to focus on the food, not how it reaches the mouth (spoon or finger). The industry has jumped on this concept that you need ""finger food"" for development and offers a wide range of highly processed addictive food. 
Read a bit about nutrition and how important it is to offer variety and diversity of taste and texture. 
It doesn't have to be the spoon. or the finger. I use my fingers for blueberries but a spoon for soups.

Both of these cups have a flat design, so they surround the cervix with their rim and sit flat against it. Menstrual cups sit at the top of the vaginal canal, still close but not as close to the cervix. Also, menstrual cups have a shape that allows them to collect liquids, so it might be more difficult for sperm to escape. The fertilily cup, I honestly don't see the point of because, sure, it will keep semen close to the cervix after intercourse but, given that we use SI, best to have two birds with one stone imho. ðŸ˜‰ 

I personally prefer that DH ejaculates straight into the soft disc and I insert it immediately, within the first 10 seconds. That way, I know that the semen is as fresh as possible and has not been handled at all by swirling it, leaving it to liquify, sucking it with a syringe. All these understandably damage the sperm.

To recap for anyone newer, I had my MVA on the 14th January. So just over three weeks ago! I'm getting vvvfl on FRER and Wondfo cheapies - just a side note here, the Wondfo cheapies are just as sensitive as the FRERs?! And a million times cheaper haha!! They're advertised as 20mIU but I swear they must be at least 10 if not closer to the FRER level of 6... Lines are tracking the same on both. 

So I'm CD 23 today and my temp has finally dropped quite a bit! So think I may ovulate tomorrow possibly? I think it tends to follow that trend. Have been DTD every other day so ðŸ¤žðŸ»

But just seen the hangover part. He might be saying that as an excuse to not come and participate in Xmas and not offend you at the same time as he's learning how to communicate with you, or he's serious but if he's serious we wouldn't judge him, as he's new to Islam so baby steps!

You can just do a simple hamper type thing, like get a glass bottle of pure juice, Tony's chocolate (larger Sainsbury's have them), a large bag of salt n vinegar crisps (tk maxx has loads that look fancy), something he may use that you know as his sister like I dunno a winter scarf or something.

Glass peanut butter jar? They have them in all supermarkets, a natural one. 
A jar of local honey.
Jam
A nice pack of nuts?
You can't go wrong with food lol.

That sort of thing. You will know what he likes better. Add some tissue paper and it will look nice. Write a little message saying this gift is because we support you on your journey... and in person say it's not an Xmas gift. 

Someone said a carved wooden Qur'an holder. That's a good idea. There's a shop called Islamic impressions. They have a nice one for Â£5 in store, can't see it online. You can call them up. They have free delivery when you spend Â£10 and lots of things on their website. 

It's really nice of you to think of him and want to remember him always. Remember random thoughts throughout the year are nice and from a Muslim perspective better than focusing on one day in a year.

Stop using any face wash. Just use water. Until skin settles down.

I disagree, look what happened to David Starkey when he cocked up last year and in an interview said:  â€œSlavery was not genocide otherwise there wouldnâ€™t be so many damn blacks in Africa or Britain, would there? An awful lot of them survived,â€.  He lost his academic positions, his publishing deals and his reputation.

P.S.  He also apologised after the event, but as a guy said on the radio the other day: if someone drops their trousers in the pub, then pulls them back up again, they are still the guy who dropped his trousers in the pub.

I would use food obsession to your advantage.  Invest in some licki mats and food dispensing toys and puzzles to keep him busy, distract him from nicking your food and also from his pain.  Iâ€™ve recently bought my boy [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Trixie-34949-Snack-Snake-Tpr/dp/B07CXMKQ8M?tag=mumsnetforu03-21 this snake]] which is tricky to fill, but keeps him busy and focussed for over half an hour, after which he konks out and sleeps for hours.

Have a good read of the [[https://caninearthritis.co.uk/ Canine Arthritis Management website and maybe join their FB group]].  So many things you can do to help him with his joint pain day to day.  Obviously he also needs a vet assessment and I would imagine regular pain meds as well.

The teeth and abscess will most likely be the source of the smell.  Again, as you already know, vet is your first stop, but daily use of something like [[https://www.petdrugsonline.co.uk/virbac-hexarinse-cat-dog-mouthwash Virbac Hexarinse]] will make a massive difference in the meantime, as it destroys the bacteria that makes the smell and also discourages plaque formation.  If he wonâ€™t have it as a mouthswash, you can just soak a microfibre dog toothbrush in the liquid and rub it liberally around his gums and teeth.

Are you lifting his feet to dry them or just wanting him to wait on the mat for a couple of minutes. If heâ€™s objecting to having his feet lifted, itâ€™s probably due to the joint pain, so investing in a really good quality, thick absorbent mat instead might be a better option. Iâ€™d invest in a really decent quality door mat, as big as you can fit in the available space.  Theyâ€™re prices, but Hug Rugs and Turtle Mats are much better at absorbing the dirt/wet quickly.  Alternatively [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B082MPP3VV/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_9?smid=A39DCAT3C6531Q&psc=1&tag=mumsnetforu03-21 these]] are cheaper, but still really good. We have them in grey and are waiting to order more when the grey comes back into stock.  Theyâ€™re lovely and soft underfoot as well.  (We have the runners around our kitchen to stop our arthritic dog from slipping.)

Pet insurance is likely to be difficult with a geriatric dog.  I think many of the bigger insurers wonâ€™t start new policies over the age of 8.  Hopefully someone with knowledge of one that does will be along soon.  Bear in mind that even if you do get a policy, teeth are unlikely to be covered and as the abscess is already there, that probably wonâ€™t be either. 

I would still go for third party insurance, even you canâ€™t get health cover though, especially as heâ€™s dog aggressive.

This enabled us to continue to swaddle even though baby had learned to roll over. Was brilliant- we all slept really well.

We tried to transition her out of the swaddle at 7.5 months using the love to dream transition swaddle. We released one arm for a few nights but found she was waving it around all night and disturbing herself. We ended up putting a long-ish sock over her hand/arm and that helped loads(we found this tip on an old MN thread!). So continued with her arm out and progressed to releasing the second arm and used the sock on it too. 

So far so good. Baby is no longer hitting her face or trying to pull the dummy out and is now no longer using the swaddle or wrap. And she is sleeping really well throughout the night.

So I think our baby just needed a little more time in the swaddle, and the sleep wrap enabled us to do this safely.

Not sure if anyone's read it, but the description kind of hooked me.

It's part of life like the seasons, we talk about those that have died and our ancestors (looking through findthegrave was interesting for mine).

I think the b vitamins would be more likely to regulate your cycle to something functional. Folk who use B6 to â€œlengthenâ€ their cycle are usually just improving their within cycle bleeding and regulating things overall, IYSWIM. It can seem that they have a short cycle because of the duration of bleeding.

Ideally you want a cycle that is about one calendar month long, with ovulation between days 10-14, with no spotting until a definite start to your period around day 28.

This is a really helpful book:

Youâ€™ll get there. But people telling you just to keep having sex when you have a long cycle are missing the point -the cycle has to be shortened to be ovulatory. Thatâ€™s not to say you might not randomly ovulate here and there, but the â€œjust sexâ€ approach can get really frustrating very quickly if you arenâ€™t doing anything else to improve the cycle and likelihood of ovulating. If someone is only ovulating 1-3x per year, is it really realistic to just keep having sex every couple of days for several years hoping to catch one of these ovulations?

4102104,We took our eye off the ball and now DS is...,teenagers,2020-12-09 19:18:37.000 +0000,"I agree , it is worth considering something like ADHD as a possibility (just a possibility).  But as others have said since I started typing this (!) can we clarify that ADHD is not a learning â€œdisorderâ€, it is a neuro-diversity and can manifest as hyperactivity, impulsiveness or inattentiveness. Though ADHD can lead to academic and behaviour problems itâ€™s not an accurate gauge of ability/intelligence.  It has to do with the way the brain uses dopamine and the behaviour  describes in their excellent post is what psychiatrists sometimes call â€˜edgingâ€™; doing risky impulsive things to try and get that hit of dopamine.  Itâ€™s worth looking at OP, not in attempt to label and categorise but in order to formulate the best approach and better to check things out and be able to cross them off the list. 
I say this as someone who wasnâ€™t diagnosed with ADHD until 52!  Had a diagnosis been possible back when I was a teen it might have meant that my wild and risky behaviour and my inability to focus and apply myself would not just have been put down to being bad, lazy and stupid.  In the end I got a good degree and career but the path there was very bumpy.

I have a 15 yo DS (he doesnâ€™t have ADHD) and he changed from a sunny and studious 11 into a moody and controversial 12 yo and by 13yo on a mission to push every possible boundary and experiment with every vice.  I agree with the previous posters like  who suggest trying to get him to engage with an activity that is managed by people who really understand the chemical shit storm that is being a teen and will interact with him differently from his parents.  This might give him a way of channelling some of the teen stuff and it might also dilute some friendships by meeting others.  If your DS is anything like mine then itâ€™s important that the suggestion to join some scheme, club, interest group does not come from you!  This takes some creativeness on your part, but he probably needs to feel heâ€™s driving it.  Perhaps there is another male he values such as an older teen who could interact with him/suggest a scheme or interest? Iâ€™ve also found that Iâ€™ve had to change the way I respond to my son and act in a fairly controlled and non-emotional way.  So with vaping, instead of becoming hysterical and pleading with him to stop (which is my natural inclination frankly), I said to him that I know he does it and I recognise heâ€™s curious but that the studies of the dangers are only now coming out and the clever people are the ones that quit and donâ€™t allow the companies producing these things to convince them vaping is edgy or cool.  All said on various car journeys in a Socratic way, asking him his opinion, no lectures.  This roundabout way has allowed a channel of communication to stay open by and large and as he approaches 16 these things have lost their appeal on the whole.  I think youâ€™re entering a period of parenting where keeping a watchful eye, holding back and choosing your battles is required whilst trying to distract him with engagement in activities as above with strong role models, and all the while letting him know youâ€™re there and that heâ€™s loved. He will roll his eyes and may tell you he doesnâ€™t feel the same but it all goes in.  Anyway, thatâ€™s more or less how weâ€™ve stumbled through the teen thing. Itâ€™s not easy.

If you can, please get a copy of The Positive Birth Book ASAP and read it. It is very empowering and gives you the right language to get what you want from your birth.

Agree that you probably need to ask for a different midwife, or for a referral to the obstetrician so that you can talk about it properly.

If you do decide you want to try vaginal birth, all of the internal checks are voluntary and you can decline them. You can chose to do your own cervical examinations. The only time someone *has* to be up your vag is if you need stitches afterwards.

My birth plan is to have a vaginal birth with pain relief, but if that isnâ€™t working I will have a c section rather than forceps delivery.

After rinsing I put in a bit of leave in conditioner then squeeze out the water and brush again. I put gel on, I'm using naughty at the moment, and squeeze my hair to encourage curls and clumping. I usually clip the top up to dry with a claw grip for lift. I hardly touch it again. Perhaps a tiny bit of leave in or curl cream to finish off

I ended up exclusively pumping for my twins who couldnâ€™t latch properly- pretty sure it was tongue tie looking back but we had a lot more pressing issues to deal with - I was pumping anyway as they were tube fed so I kept going. 

Firstly, it sounds like youâ€™re using the wrong size flange (funnel bit) if repeatedly slipping off. Over time this will cause trauma - in the meantime if you have a stretchy bra you can spare, cut a cross in each cup as a makeshift hands free pumping bra. 

Consumer grade pumps are often a bit crap and often donâ€™t  come with different size flanges. I had an Ardo Calypso double pump which was brilliant, not expensive and comes with different sizes. Argos sell them and often have same day delivery on some things or amazon will deliver by Tuesday 
[[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ardo-Calypso-Double-Plus-Breastpump/dp/B00JNCTAKW/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?dchild=1&s=baby&keywords=ardo+calypso&sprefix=ardo+cal&tag=mumsnetforu03-21&qid=1608498828&sr=1-1]]

I think Ardo do next day delivery. 

[[https://www.ardobreastpumps.co.uk/shop/products/buy-a-breastpump/pump-up-the-volume/]]

If you canâ€™t get on with the one you have, I would get another. Good thing about Ardo Calypso is theyâ€™re a closed system so you can sell them on when youâ€™re done. 

Google the Stanford pumping technique - theres a very dated but very useful video. Combines pumping with breast compression to maximise supply.

If you want to try latching again then google the flipple technique - a way of getting a deeper latch often suggested when thereâ€™s a tie. Try some other holds - one of mine could only latch at all if lying on his right hand side, so experiment. Also have a look at rugby ball hold and laid back Feeding position, and try when he starting to get wriggly rather than crying with hunger - you can google hunger cues to show you what the earliest signs are. 

Unfortunately lots of tongue tie services are limited during COVID to those cases where the baby is not gaining weight etc. Definitely ask and be assertive  but also have a look online to see if anyone can do it privately at your home. I wish I had paid for this in hindsight but I didnâ€™t. 

I pumped every 2 hours round the clock at first which is hard going but unfortunately important to keep supply up. 

I remember only too well how desperate I felt when mine wouldnâ€™t latch - try not to panic, keep your supply up as best you can, try to get the tongue tie sorted, if you can afford it get some advice from an IBCLC lactation consultant. Just because he canâ€™t latch now doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s over - I know plenty whoâ€™ve pumped initially then managed to establish BFing, hell I even know people who have relactated after stopping completely. 

Hang in there, stay as calm as you can, stanford pumping, frequent pumping, different flanges / pump, deep latch, different holds and feed when calm before he gets too hangry.

This might not be big enough or heavy enough for a ten Yr old you'll have to check it out. 

Sleep deprivation nearly destroyed my marriage too, still not recovered any intimacy and will see what happens when the children are older.

In the end the two things that worked best to help my Dd were bedtime tokens system, which is a bit like this :
[[https://www.drgreene.com/bedtime-pass-program]]
But we used loads of tokens at first and gradually reduced the number, so Dd used 32 the first night and gradually reduced down to 3, if she had tokens left in the morning she got a sweet (because sod it). 

And this technique that's used for adults with 'middle insomnia', so Dd always woke at 1:30am for hours. 6:30pm bedtime because she was so tired. So she could sleep from 630-130 = 7hrs. 6am was morning, minus 7hrs she would sleep for, gave us a bedtime 11pm. The idea is for a few nights stay up until 11pm. Yes it will be horrible. Then gradually move bedtime forward in increments to a more reasonable time. We couldn't quite hack 11pm but did 9:30pm and then gradually snuck forward to 8pm.

I have a reception child and a Y3 and itâ€™s very hard to keep them occupied, although my Y3 is at least able to get on with school work on his own for longer periods. 

My son in reception enjoys cosmic kids yoga, and is very keen on doing his â€˜workâ€™ on the iPad - we do try to limit this but have found Crazy Cursive (app) and Phonics Bloom (website - phonics games) to be at least vaguely educational and they hold his attention for longer periods when we need to help his brother. 

Otherwise weâ€™re doing a lot of handwriting practice. He enjoys practising his letters in sand and on wipe clean books. Also chalk on a blackboard. I remember being told that doing sensory writing helps their muscle memory. Weâ€™ve written a couple of (very short) letters to his friends and had exciting replies. He does the White Rose maths videos as well and we always end up getting out teddies/buttons on plates etc to recreate the activity so that takes up a bit of time. We get other schoolwork home but nothing great heâ€™ll concentrate on for more than max 15 minutes at a time. 

Heâ€™s just had his birthday and got some StoryOrchestra books, which have really captured his imagination. The other thing he loves doing at the moment is excavating dinosaur fossils from plaster of Paris like this

4158557,First psychiatrist appointment ,am_i_being_unreasonable,2021-02-07 10:08:02.000 +0000,"I second EMDR. I had repeated childhood traumas (sexual and physical abuse, neglect) and trauma later in life. I have seen a number of psychiatrists over the years but none of them were interested in trauma, they were only interested in diagnosis and medication - neither of which helped. In fact, a diagnosis made it worse because whatever I was feeling was attributed to bipolar disorder and my traumatic history was swept under the rug.

It is only in the last couple of years, since having psychodynamic therapy, that I have begun to experience fewer depressions. I have just started EMDR after reading The Body Keeps the Score, which I would recommend to anyone who has experienced trauma. [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Body-Keeps-Score-Transformation-Trauma/dp/0141978619/ref=nodl_?tag=mumsnetforu03-21]] I tried to receive it on the NHS but they told me EMDR is only for â€˜traumatised peopleâ€™ which sums up their wilful ignorance of my history.

A psychiatrist may try to diagnose you with EUPD but be aware that there is a lot of controversy around this diagnosis, as it is often seen as a catch-all for people - particularly women - who grew up with trauma and thus rather invalidates their unique experiences. They may try to prescribe you antipsychotic medications like quetiapine or resperidone which can cause debilitating side effects such as weight gain or cognitive issues, and there is a lack of evidence to support their usefulness in trauma. Do read up on anything they offer very thoroughly so you can make an informed decision on whether medication is the right option for you.

There is a lot of evidence to support EMDRâ€™s effectiveness in treating trauma and there are many people who make a full recovery after treatment. You also arenâ€™t required to go into detail about the trauma, unlike other therapies that can involve talking about the trauma over and over, which is potentially retraumatising.

Good luck OP. Remember that none of this means there is something â€˜wrongâ€™ with you or that you are mentally ill. You are experiencing an understandable response to multiple traumas.

I'm 36 and have suffered my whole adult life except for 2yrs after my first lot of accutane. Firstly, your dose doesn't sound that high. I was only on it 6months but I was on 80mg for much of that - I weigh 9stone. If the dose doesn't go high enough then I've heard that can be a reason for it not working. 
As I said though, mine came back eventually. The single biggest effect on my skin is carbs and sugar. Have you tried doing a keto diet? If not I highly recommend it. I don't do full keto - I still eat lots of veggies but avoid starchy ones like potatoes, butternut squash, sweet pot etc. So it's more low carb than no carb. I do still have dairy which I find is ok as long as carbs are low but you've gotta make sure you're having the full fat stuff. Also try and eat regularly, don't skip meals and snack on nuts to keep your blood sugar level even all day. 
In addition to this, go really gentle with your skin care regime because the more you do to the skin, the weaker the barrier. I use these products:

4124005,I'm f**c*d aren't I,am_i_being_unreasonable,2021-01-03 10:54:07.000 +0000,"You're fucked if you *don't* stop.  You know two things:
1. The liver ^can^ recover, even from serious abuse.
2. Women in general cannot survive as much alcohol abuse as men.
Thinking you're going to die soon is an excuse to keep drinking. Shake it off.

So the best time to start is now.  On my 'last day' I actually chose not to drink. I was seriously ill and going to see the GP the next day. I knew I could drink and it wouldn't really make any difference to the outcome, but it mattered to me.  You can decide whether or not to drink today, but if you're planning to try and stop in secret, I can guarantee the decision you make today will shape how you get on.

However, my top tips would be:
1. Do not try and stop in secret. Speak to your GP.  If she/he wants blood tests doing, do them. (You also know that the bloods can come back looking relatively normal even when the damage is quite severe).
2. Do not try and stop in secret. Tell your friends you are stopping. You can call it Dry January to start off with, or [[https://www.oneyearnobeer.com/ One Year No Beer]].
3. Do not try and stop in secret. Seek help.  The right form of help is up to you.

And then beyond that - make sure you anticipate your triggers.  Be watchful for them, plan ahead. They may be unexpected.

*Keith* (or rather, *Viking*) Thanks for the suggestion of *Railhead* - that looks really interesting (although probably a bit old for DS at the moment, as you said). We are actually members of the Calibre audio library but had let it lapse a few months ago â€“ time to start borrowing again, I think!

Love the plums/icebox parody *Satusuki* (and good to have you back!) [grin]

*Fortuna* yikes, 45 hours is quite a commitment! I do normally listen on something between 1.1 and 1.5 speed (depending on how brisk or turgid the narration is), so hopefully it will be doable in less than that. Iâ€™m definitely tempted now â€“ it sounds like the ideal way to pass the time while cleaning the kitchen or tidying up.

Thanks also for the incredibly generous offer!

Iâ€™d love any CDs you have that arenâ€™t already on that collection, though â€“ thank you!

*LadybirdDaphne* thanks for a very interesting review of *Inventing Ourselves* [smile].

*Stokey* Cressida Cowell is a great suggestion, thank you â€“ I think DD (7) has already read one of the HTTYD books, and it would be great to have a series than can be enjoyed by both DCs at once. What a great thread this is for getting ideas!

*ChessieFL* DD watched a Brownies panto last month that had Anna McNuff in it â€“ I think sheâ€™s some sort of ambassador for the Brownies. Her books sounded interesting but she came across as a bit self-consciously wacky, so I wasnâ€™t sure about getting one. Itâ€™s good to have your take on it!

*Razorstorm* welcome! I read *Chasing the Dram* last year as I am also a whisky/Scotland fan. It was a very light read but I also learned quite a bit, especially about blended whisky (about which I knew nothing!).

The NHS advocates for the 'watchful waiting' approach - but I do know schools and many medical providers have been a little indoctrinated in to thinking that the only path is positive 'affirmation'. We have seen a 4000% rise in girls wanting to become boys in the last 5 years; some say that it's because being trans is more acceptable so that it's now more public, but others see it as being another form of female self-hatred - ie cutting and anorexia.  My belief is that this is socially contagious - are there other kids she knows who are doing this? Can you look through her internet browsing history to see what she has been looking at? 

First port of call I would suggest is Bayswater - [[https://www.bayswatersupport.org.uk https://www.bayswatersupport.org.uk]]
They will offer support and might have a list of counsellors in the U.K. which will help with going deeper in to the root cause of the problem.

4154545,Five year old for an oldie novice?,the_tack_room,2021-02-04 15:32:21.000 +0000,"Hi OP,  I only started riding at 45 (almost 3 years ago). I just took to it like a duck to water and loved the horses, Iâ€™d never really been about horses before that. I bought my first horse almost 2 years ago but was mis-sold a horse with Kissing Spine `(she passed a 5 stage vetting but had issues the minute we got her home and we found the cause months later!), I really had no clue what I was doing! I was never able to ride her. She had to be retired. I couldnâ€™t send her anywhere else as Iâ€™d taken her on as my responsibility and I loved her and didnâ€™t want anyone trying to make money from her (like the dealer Iâ€™d bought her from).

Thankfully I ended up on an amazing yard with a super supportive yard owner/trainer.  My husband also rides. So we bought a second horse, older (14), but a warmblood competition horse. Heâ€™s been fantastic, I adore him. Heâ€™s super forgiving re mistakes but can be spooky and has been a challenge, had a few falls (rider error) but heâ€™s really a dream and has been great for us.

Then, as my husband and I wanted to be able to ride together, we bought an Irish Sports Horse last summer. We wanted a younger horse as I didnâ€™t want to end up, in a few years time, with three old horses all at the same time, we were really looking for one about 10 years old, but he had only turned 7 but with an old head on his shoulders. Heâ€™s mainly hunted though, so needs schooling brought on which happens with the help of yard owner/trainer. Heâ€™s a more straightforward, less spooky ride than our other gelding despite being younger. He was Kevin the teenager on the ground when we got him but really good now.

The points Iâ€™d make to you are:
It takes work to keep even a good horse good, our warmblood doesnâ€™t have a bad bone in his body but heâ€™s used to more advanced riders. We have plenty lessons (a few a week) on both geldings to keep warmblood good and to bring on the ISH. And where required, where issues need resolving, I pay for trainer to school them for a bit. You need to make sure youâ€™ll have plenty support.

Re letting one you get be used in lessons, you would have to be so careful re this as you donâ€™t want negative input. I wouldnâ€™t let anyone ride ours who isnâ€™t at least as good as us, no way. Itâ€™s hard enough for non-advanced riders to keep horses good in terms of behaviours, attitudes, and aptitude.

I really think a very young horse would be a bad move.

Lastly, re your canter fear, Iâ€™ve also had canter issues previously. Iâ€™d really recommend a therapy such as NLP to help with that, you could be doing that just now when youâ€™re unable to ride ðŸ˜Š Iâ€™d recommend this one:

4160802,Crippling Health Anxiety,_chat,2021-02-09 16:41:11.000 +0000,"I hear you, I get it as well. It's exhausting.

The best way forward is to begin to create strategies to manage it. And trying to understand where it comes from.

For me -- and this is just a personal observation as it's different for everyone -- the health anxiety is a manifestation of a deeper and more general feeling of low self-worth. When I was little I was often yelled at by parents and teachers and I developed a paranoia about 'getting it wrong' in general terms. I find myself double- and triple-checking ^everything^ in everyday life. I also had a mother whose default emotional position was 'the world is a dangerous place'. Around my mid 30s this somehow transferred to health stuff -- ^what if I've mistaken this utterly ordinary thing for a terrible disease?^ is basically the thought process.

Over the last five or six years I've diagnosed myself with bowel cancer, heart failure, a brain tumour, schizophrenia, kidney cancer, mouth cancer, and goodness knows how many others.

Importantly as a diagnostician I have a zero percent success rate and despite my terrible predictions here I still am, buggering on. <waves fake stethoscope, uselessly> I'm a bit fat and I've got IBS and that's it.

With me it's definitely triggered by feelings of low self-worth. This year has been especially difficult because being locked away I feel completely invisible. And yes worthless. So naturally I --obsess over-- focus on those little bodily tweaks and twinges more than I otherwise would. It's almost like subconsciously I think I 'deserve' to get ill because my self-worth is so low.

However, I do try to tackle it. Being aware of the fact that when I'm worrying about health, I'm actually replaying aspects of the way I was treated as a child can be very helpful in taking some of the sting out of the worry.

The other thing is that Google (and other search engines) simply make things 100x worse. So I highly recommend never Googling anything health related! Google prioritises things that it thinks people will want to click on ('cos that's how it makes money). People tend to click on frightening-sounding pages about serious illness and so ^bibbety-bobbety-boop!^ Google ranks these kinds of pages higher. This can lead us to think that what is actually quite a rare illness is more likely, because Google's just listed it as the top of a search.

 - the mental load thing is a huge one IMO. Constantly worrying about how people perceive you, worrying about not being taken seriously by medical professionals etc. I went to a talk given at a black professional network and the question came up of the 'burden' that successful women face in that as well as being brilliant, they also have to raise other black women up as well. Certainly, women in my family were constantly on the go with community meetings, charity work, on top of busy jobs, with little time for just sitting down for a rest, never mind exercise and wellbeing. The 'black excellence' mindset is both a blessing and a curse.

I also think that generational trauma is huge for us as black women. So many of our parents/grandparents went through real trauma in the severe racism they faced and how hard they had to struggle in the early days over here. Not to mention even worse trauma a few generations before that. This sometimes isn't talked about in families, which can be really damaging. I've encountered a stoic attitude and unwillingness to engage in therapy because they're so used to life being hard. I think this has a huge impact on our mental health.

 - I agree that exercise can be such a white space. I live in S London and it can be rare to see black women running. There are some brilliant groups trying to change this - FlyGirl Collective, We Run We Eat (podcast) and lots of online influencers. It's so important to see others who look like you exercising. I was SO self conscious at school about my figure (classic big bum/hips) because there were few people who looked like me. As I've got older I'm much more accepting and learning to exercise for general health and wellbeing, not to fit an external beauty standard, but it took years to develop confidence in gym classes where white girls would see me as a 'before picture'.",18.32472222,writer tackled issue black weight wrote novel subject got criticism ref kindle redirect tag mental load thing huge one constantly worrying people perceive worrying taken seriously medical went talk given black professional network question came burden successful face well brilliant also raise black well certainly family constantly community charity work top busy little time sitting rest never mind exercise black excellence blessing curse also think generational trauma huge black many went real trauma severe racism faced hard struggle early days mention even worse trauma sometimes really stoic attitude unwillingness engage therapy used life hard think huge impact mental health agree exercise white space live rare see black running brilliant trying change collective run eat lots important see look like self conscious school figure classic big bum people like got older much learning exercise general health fit external beauty standard took develop confidence gym classes white would see picture,['https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B007M82RMM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1&tag=mumsnetforu03-21 here'],['Kindle Store']

But be prepared it may matter to little one at times, and he may feel it is significant. I had to allow my ds to feel that way and express it (he is 10 now). Because me saying a lot that 'it didn't matter' that he wasn't born from my tummy, was hard for him.

Most of the time it is just a fact, I am mum, and dad is dad and he doesn't mention it. But for our little ones it is a factor of life to deal with and to be able to talk about openly. I find now, when we do talk, I am more likely to feel upset!

Does your little one have a life story book? Did you adopt in the UK?

We use the term birth mum, or her name. Birth father or his name. He wasn't that close to birth father, if he had been I might say birth dad. 

If in the UK you may find post adoption support can help with this. 

Depending why he had to leave his birth family you may find Nutmeg gets adopted is helpful later. But it may not be appropriate and your local adoption agency/county council may have a copy you can read before buying.

Some of these are showing longer delivery times on amazon. I would recommend calling your local independent bookshop with a list if the books you want, they can normally get books with a few days - much faster than amazon.

Also, if you can go your local independent bookshop or library and browse I would bet money they have a better choice than online as trained librarians and book sellers are often much more conscious about trying to provide a balanced selection of books than online sellers.
